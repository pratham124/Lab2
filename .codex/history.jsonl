Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `UC-11.md UC-11-AT.md` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-11.md UC-11-AT.md\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-11.md UC-11-AT.md\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-11.md UC-11-AT.md\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}

If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}

They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes?

[Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented?

[Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n- \"Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is versioning strategy documented in requirements? [Gap]\"\n\n**Performance Requirements Quality:** `performance.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are performance requirements quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]\"\n- \"Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n\n**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]\n- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]\n- [ ] CHK006 - Can \"visual hierarchy\" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n"}

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}

Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-11: FR-003 requires accept/reject. Remove 'out of scope' from pending→accepted/rejected in data-model.md; keep auto pending→declined. Add POST /review-invitations/{id}/response {decision: accept|reject} to contracts with 200 + 401/403/404/409; only pending can transition.\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-11: FR-003 requires accept/reject. Remove 'out of scope' from pending→accepted/rejected in data-model.md; keep auto pending→declined. Add POST /review-invitations/{id}/response {decision: accept|reject} to contracts with 200 + 401/403/404/409; only pending can transition.\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-11: FR-003 requires accept/reject.

Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}

All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)\n   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)\n   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.\n\n3. **Execute task generation workflow**:\n   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure\n   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)\n   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories\n   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories\n   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks\n   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order\n   - Create parallel execution examples per user story\n   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)\n\n4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:\n   - Correct feature name from plan.md\n   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)\n   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)\n   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)\n   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks\n   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns\n   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)\n   - Clear file paths for each task\n   - Dependencies section showing story completion order\n   - Parallel execution examples per story\n   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)\n\n5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:\n   - Total task count\n   - Task count per user story\n   - Parallel opportunities identified\n   - Independent test criteria for each story\n   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)\n   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)\n\nContext for task generation: \n\nThe tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.\n\n## Task Generation Rules\n\n**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.\n\n**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.\n\n### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)\n\nEvery task MUST strictly follow this format:\n\n```text\n- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path\n```\n\n**Format Components**:\n\n1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)\n2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order\n3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)\n4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only\n   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)\n   - Setup phase: NO story label\n   - Foundational phase: NO story label  \n   - User Story phases: MUST have story label\n   - Polish phase: NO story label\n5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path\n\n**Examples**:\n\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`\n- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)\n- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)\n- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)\n\n### Task Organization\n\n1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:\n   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase\n   - Map all related components to their story:\n     - Models needed for that story\n     - Services needed for that story\n     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story\n     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story\n   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)\n\n2. **From Contracts**:\n   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves\n   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase\n\n3. **From Data Model**:\n   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it\n   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase\n   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase\n\n4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:\n   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)\n   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)\n   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase\n\n### Phase Structure\n\n- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)\n- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)\n- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)\n  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration\n  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment\n- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\n"}
{"session_id":"019c1fbd-36ca-74a2-9cb5-1f587ddc334e","ts":1770059217,"text":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Goal\n\nIdentify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}

Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6.

Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}
