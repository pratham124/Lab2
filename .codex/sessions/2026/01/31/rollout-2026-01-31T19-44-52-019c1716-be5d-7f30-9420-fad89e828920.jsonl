You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"63cfe88fff269691cec0266c783138c31c8bd3fe","branch":"UC-01","repository_url":"https://github.com/pratham124/Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n The writable roots are `/root/493-lab/Lab2`, `/tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `UC-01.md` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c.

Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4.

Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-01.md\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-01.md\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-01.md\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

The system responds by presenting a registration form requesting an email address and password. The user enters a valid, unique email address and a password that meets the system’s security requirements, then submits the form. The system verifies that the email address is correctly formatted and not already associated with an existing account. It also checks that the password satisfies the required security standards. After successful validation, the system creates a new user account and stores the user’s information securely in the database. The system then redirects the user to the login page, allowing the user to proceed with accessing CMS features.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 4a — Email Address Already Registered\n\nDuring registration, the user submits an email address that is already associated with an existing CMS account. When the system checks email uniqueness, it detects the conflict. The system rejects the registration attempt and displays an error message informing the user that the email address is already registered. The user remains on the registration page and is given the opportunity to correct the email address or abandon the registration process. No user account is created.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 5a — Password Does Not Meet Security Requirements\n\nThe user submits the registration form with a password that does not meet the CMS security standards. The system detects the violation during password validation. The registration process is halted, and the system displays an error message explaining the password requirements. The user remains on the registration page and may enter a new password that satisfies the constraints. No data is saved until a valid password is provided.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error\n\nAfter the user submits valid registration information, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to store the new account information in the database. The system aborts the registration process and displays a failure message indicating that registration could not be completed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The user account is not created, and the user may attempt to register again later.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

no new use cases introduced.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a registration option for unregistered visitors.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST present a registration form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST validate email format and uniqueness before creating an account.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate passwords against the CMS password policy and present the requirements on failure.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST create an account only after all validations pass.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent more than one account from being created for the same email, including rapid resubmissions.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display clear, non-technical error messages when registration fails and MUST NOT create an account on failure.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST redirect the user to the login page after successful registration.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to correct inputs and retry registration without losing unrelated form data.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST record failed registration attempts for operational review.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Represents a registered user with email, credentials, status, and creation time.\n- **Registration Attempt**: Captures a single submission with email input, timestamp, and outcome.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The CMS already defines a password policy; this feature enforces that existing policy without changing it.\n- Email verification, CAPTCHA, and multi-factor authentication are out of scope unless separately specified.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users can complete registration in under 2 minutes in usability testing.\n- **SC-002**: At least 90% of users with valid inputs successfully complete registration on their first attempt.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of duplicate-email attempts are blocked from creating a new account in test runs.\n- **SC-004**: At least 95% of failed registrations display a clear, user-friendly reason for failure.\n"}}

(trim before validation)\n- What happens when required fields are left blank?\n- How does the system behave if the email is valid but the password fails policy?\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-01\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-01-AT\n- **Notes**: Uses existing UC-01 and UC-01-AT; no new use cases introduced.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a registration option for unregistered visitors.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST present a registration form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST validate email format and uniqueness before creating an account, using case-insensitive comparison after trimming leading/trailing whitespace.\n- **FR-003a**: System MUST reject registration if the email differs only by case from an existing account.\n- **FR-003b**: System MUST allow only one account per email address.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate passwords against the CMS password policy and present the requirements on failure.\n- **FR-004a**: System MUST enforce a baseline password policy of at least 8 characters with at least 1 letter and 1 number.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST create an account only after all validations pass.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent more than one account from being created for the same email, including rapid resubmissions.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display clear, non-technical error messages when registration fails and MUST NOT create an account on failure.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST redirect the user to the login page after successful registration.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to correct inputs and retry registration without losing unrelated form data.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST record all failed registration attempts, including validation failures and system errors, for operational review.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Represents a registered user with email, credentials, status, and creation time.\n- **Registration Attempt**: Captures a single submission with email input, timestamp, and outcome.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The CMS may define additional password rules; this feature enforces at least the baseline policy defined above.\n- Email verification, CAPTCHA, and multi-factor authentication are out of scope unless separately specified.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users can complete registration in under 2 minutes in usability testing.\n- **SC-002**: At least 90% of users with valid inputs successfully complete registration on their first attempt.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of duplicate-email attempts are blocked from creating a new account in test runs.\n- **SC-004**: At least 95% of failed registrations display a clear, user-friendly reason for failure.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes?

[Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures?

[Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n- \"Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured?

[Clarity]\"\n- \"Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]\"\n- \"Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n\n**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]\n- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]\n- [ ] CHK006 - Can \"visual hierarchy\" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n"}]}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes?

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]\"\n   - \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]\"\n   - \"Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]\"\n\n   Clarity:\n   - \"Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]\"\n   - \"Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]\"\n   - \"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n   Consistency:\n   - \"Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]\"\n   - \"Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]\"\n\n   Coverage:\n   - \"Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]\"\n   - \"Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting.

[Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented?

[Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n"}]}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes?

[Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements?

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(trim before validation)\n- What happens when required fields are left blank?\n- How does the system behave if the email is valid but the password fails policy?\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-01\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-01-AT\n- **Notes**: Uses existing UC-01 and UC-01-AT; no new use cases introduced.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a registration option for unregistered visitors.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST present a registration form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST validate email format and uniqueness before creating an account, using case-insensitive comparison after trimming leading/trailing whitespace.\n- **FR-003a**: System MUST reject registration if the email differs only by case from an existing account.\n- **FR-003b**: System MUST allow only one account per email address.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate passwords against the CMS password policy and present the requirements on failure.\n- **FR-004a**: System MUST enforce a baseline password policy of at least 8 characters with at least 1 letter and 1 number.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST create an account only after all validations pass.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent more than one account from being created for the same email, including rapid resubmissions.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display clear, non-technical error messages when registration fails and MUST NOT create an account on failure.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST redirect the user to the login page after successful registration.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to correct inputs and retry registration without losing unrelated form data.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST record all failed registration attempts, including validation failures and system errors, for operational review.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Represents a registered user with email, credentials, status, and creation time.\n- **Registration Attempt**: Captures a single submission with email input, timestamp, and outcome.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The CMS may define additional password rules; this feature enforces at least the baseline policy defined above.\n- Email verification, CAPTCHA, and multi-factor authentication are out of scope unless separately specified.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users can complete registration in under 2 minutes in usability testing.\n- **SC-002**: At least 90% of users with valid inputs successfully complete registration on their first attempt.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of duplicate-email attempts are blocked from creating a new account in test runs.\n- **SC-004**: At least 95% of failed registrations display a clear, user-friendly reason for failure.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b.

List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3.

Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n"}]}}

Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.\n\n8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):\n   - Number of questions asked & answered.\n   - Path to updated spec.\n   - Sections touched (list names).\n   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).\n   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.\n   - Suggested next command.\n\nBehavior rules:\n\n- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: \"No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification.\" and suggest proceeding.\n- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).\n- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).\n- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.\n- Respect user early termination signals (\"stop\", \"done\", \"proceed\").\n- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.\n- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.\n\nContext for prioritization: \n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

(trim before validation)\n- What happens when required fields are left blank (email shows \"Email is required\", password shows \"Password is required\")?\n- How does the system behave if the email is valid but the password fails policy?\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-01\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-01-AT\n- **Notes**: Uses existing UC-01 and UC-01-AT; no new use cases introduced.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a registration option for unregistered visitors.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST present a registration form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST validate email format and uniqueness before creating an account, using case-insensitive comparison after trimming leading/trailing whitespace.\n- **FR-003c**: System MUST validate email format against RFC 5322.\n- **FR-003a**: System MUST reject registration if the email differs only by case from an existing account.\n- **FR-003b**: System MUST allow only one account per email address.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate passwords against the CMS password policy and present the requirements on failure.\n- **FR-004a**: System MUST enforce a baseline password policy of at least 8 characters with at least 1 letter and 1 number.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST create an account only after all validations pass.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent more than one account from being created for the same email, including rapid resubmissions.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display clear, non-technical error messages when registration fails and MUST NOT create an account on failure.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST redirect the user to the login page after successful registration.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to correct inputs and retry registration without losing unrelated form data.\n- **FR-009a**: System MUST display \"Email is required\" when the email field is blank.\n- **FR-009b**: System MUST display \"Password is required\" when the password field is blank.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST record all failed registration attempts, including validation failures and system errors, for operational review.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Represents a registered user with email, credentials, status, and creation time.\n- **Registration Attempt**: Captures a single submission with email input, timestamp, and outcome.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The CMS may define additional password rules; this feature enforces at least the baseline policy defined above.\n- Email verification, CAPTCHA, and multi-factor authentication are out of scope unless separately specified.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users can complete registration in under 2 minutes in usability testing.\n- **SC-002**: At least 90% of users with valid inputs successfully complete registration on their first attempt.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of duplicate-email attempts are blocked from creating a new account in test runs.\n- **SC-004**: At least 95% of failed registrations display a clear, user-friendly reason for failure.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(trim before validation)\n- What happens when required fields are left blank (email shows \"Email is required\", password shows \"Password is required\")?\n- How does the system behave if the email is valid but the password fails policy?\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-01\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-01-AT\n- **Notes**: Uses existing UC-01 and UC-01-AT; no new use cases introduced.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a registration option for unregistered visitors.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST present a registration form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST validate email format and uniqueness before creating an account, using case-insensitive comparison after trimming leading/trailing whitespace.\n- **FR-003c**: System MUST validate email format against RFC 5322.\n- **FR-003a**: System MUST reject registration if the email differs only by case from an existing account.\n- **FR-003b**: System MUST allow only one account per email address.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate passwords against the CMS password policy and present the requirements on failure.\n- **FR-004a**: System MUST enforce a baseline password policy of at least 8 characters with at least 1 letter and 1 number.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST create an account only after all validations pass.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent more than one account from being created for the same email, including rapid resubmissions.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST display clear, non-technical error messages when registration fails and MUST NOT create an account on failure.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST redirect the user to the login page after successful registration.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to correct inputs and retry registration without losing unrelated form data.\n- **FR-009a**: System MUST display \"Email is required\" when the email field is blank.\n- **FR-009b**: System MUST display \"Password is required\" when the password field is blank.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST record all failed registration attempts, including validation failures and system errors, for operational review.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Represents a registered user with email, credentials, status, and creation time.\n- **Registration Attempt**: Captures a single submission with email input, timestamp, and outcome.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The CMS may define additional password rules; this feature enforces at least the baseline policy defined above.\n- Email verification, CAPTCHA, and multi-factor authentication are out of scope unless separately specified.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Users can complete registration in under 2 minutes in usability testing.\n- **SC-002**: At least 90% of users with valid inputs successfully complete registration on their first attempt.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of duplicate-email attempts are blocked from creating a new account in test runs.\n- **SC-004**: At least 95% of failed registrations display a clear, user-friendly reason for failure.\n"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All acceptance test updates for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Update acceptance tests for User Story 1 first:\nTask: \"Update/add acceptance tests in UC-XX-AT.md\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify acceptance criteria are defined before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

user story implementation can now begin in parallel\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create a new account (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\\n\\n**Goal**: Allow a new user to register with a unique email and valid password, then redirect to login.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Complete a successful registration and verify redirect to login with exactly one account created.\\n\\n### Acceptance Tests for User Story 1 (REQUIRED) ⚠️\\n\\n- [ ] T008 [P] [US1] Update acceptance tests in `UC-01-AT.md` for successful registration and duplicate prevention (if needed)\\n- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] Verify UC-01-AT scenarios cover success redirect and no duplicate account creation\\n\\n### Implementation for User Story 1\\n\\n- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Create User Account model in `src/models/user_account.js`\\n- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create Registration Attempt model in `src/models/registration_attempt.js`\\n- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement registration service in `src/services/registration_service.js` (uses T004–T007, T010–T011)\\n- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement registration controller in `src/controllers/registration_controller.js` (handles GET/POST)\\n- [ ] T014 [US1] Create registration view in `src/views/register.html`\\n- [ ] T015 [US1] Add client-side form handling in `public/js/register.js` (submit + redirect handling)\\n- [ ] T016 [US1] Add registration styling in `public/css/register.css`\\n\\n**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Receive clear validation feedback (Priority: P2)\\n\\n**Goal**: Provide clear validation messages for invalid inputs and keep user on the registration page.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Submit invalid inputs and confirm specific error messages without account creation.\\n\\n### Acceptance Tests for User Story 2 (REQUIRED) ⚠️\\n\\n- [ ] T017 [P] [US2] Update acceptance tests in `UC-01-AT.md` for invalid email, duplicate email, and required-field messages\\n- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Verify UC-01-AT scenarios cover RFC 5322 validation and required-field messages\\n\\n### Implementation for User Story 2\\n\\n- [ ] T019 [US2] Add RFC 5322 email validation to `src/services/email_utils.js` (extend T004)\\n- [ ] T020 [US2] Add required-field message constants in `src/services/validation_messages.js`\\n- [ ] T021 [US2] Update `src/services/registration_service.js` to return field-level validation errors\\n- [ ] T022 [US2] Update `src/controllers/registration_controller.js` to render field-level errors\\n- [ ] T023 [US2] Update `src/views/register.html` to display field-level errors\\n- [ ] T024 [US2] Update `public/js/register.js` to show inline validation feedback\\n\\n**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 should be independently testable with validation feedback\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 5: User Story 3 -

can start immediately\\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\\n  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)\\n  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\\n\\n### User Story Dependencies\\n\\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 for validation UX but remains independently testable\\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires core registration flow from US1\\n\\n### Within Each User Story\\n\\n- Acceptance tests updated before implementation tasks\\n- Models before services\\n- Services before controllers/views\\n- Controllers/views before client-side UX updates\\n\\n### Parallel Opportunities\\n\\n- T002, T003 can run in parallel\\n- T004–T007 can run in parallel\\n- Acceptance test updates (T008, T017, T025) can run in parallel with model creation tasks within each story\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\\n\\n```bash\\n# Update acceptance tests for User Story 1 first:\\nTask: \\\"Update acceptance tests in UC-01-AT.md\\\"\\n\\n# Launch models for User Story 1 together:\\nTask: \\\"Create User Account model in src/models/user_account.js\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Create Registration Attempt model in src/models/registration_attempt.js\\\"\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Implementation Strategy\\n\\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\\n\\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\\n\\n### Incremental Delivery\\n\\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP)\\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\\n- Verify acceptance criteria are defined before implementing\\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/root/493-lab/Lab2\"}","call_id":"call_p1OahGNvuFPnF1SHHHPOxGMU"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
