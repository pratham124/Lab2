You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"63cfe88fff269691cec0266c783138c31c8bd3fe","branch":"UC-02","repository_url":"https://github.com/pratham124/Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n The writable roots are `/root/493-lab/Lab2`, `/tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `UC-02.md` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c.

Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4.

Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-02.md\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-02.md\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-02.md\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

The system responds by displaying a login form requesting the user’s email address and password. The user enters valid credentials associated with an existing CMS account and submits the form. The system verifies that the provided email exists in the database and that the entered password matches the stored credentials. After successful authentication, the system establishes a user session and redirects the user to their dashboard, where authorized CMS features are accessible.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 4a — Account Does Not Exist\n\nThe user attempts to log in using an email address that is not associated with any registered CMS account. During credential verification, the system fails to find a matching account for the provided email. The system rejects the login attempt and displays an error message indicating that the account does not exist. The user remains on the login page and may choose to re-enter credentials or abandon the login process. No user session is created.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 4b — Incorrect Password\n\nThe user enters a valid registered email address but provides an incorrect password. When the system compares the submitted credentials with those stored in the database, the password verification fails. The system denies access and displays an error message indicating that the credentials are invalid. The user remains on the login page and is allowed to retry logging in. No user session is created.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 4c — System or Database Error\n\nAfter the user submits valid login credentials, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to verify the credentials against the database. The authentication process is aborted, and the system displays a login failure message indicating that the user cannot be logged in at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The user is not authenticated, and no session is established.\n"}}

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Graceful handling of verification failures (Priority: P3)\n\nIf the system cannot verify credentials due to an internal issue, the user sees a failure message and can try again later.\n\n**Why this priority**: The login experience must fail safely and inform users when the system is unavailable.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a verification failure and confirming the user is not authenticated.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a system error during credential verification, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** a login failure message is shown and no dashboard access is granted.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the user submits the login form with a missing email or password?\n- How does the system handle repeated failed login attempts in a short period?\n- What happens when the authentication service is unavailable?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST accept login submissions only for registered user accounts.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate the user and grant access to the dashboard when valid credentials are provided.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST display an error indicating the account does not exist when the email is unregistered.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST display an error indicating credentials are invalid when the password is incorrect.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a login failure message when credential verification cannot be completed due to a system error.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST keep the user on the login page after a failed login and allow retry.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent dashboard access when authentication fails for any reason.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST record an internal error event when credential verification fails due to a system error.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user identity with email, credential record, and account status.\n- **Login Attempt**: A record of a submitted login with timestamp and outcome (success, invalid credentials, system error).\n- **Authenticated Session**: The active authenticated state that enables access to authorized CMS features during a visit.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of login attempts with valid credentials reach the dashboard within 30 seconds.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of failed login attempts display an error message and do not grant dashboard access.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of surveyed users rate the login experience as clear and easy.\n- **SC-004**: Support requests about login failures decrease by 25% within 60 days of release.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Account lockout rules, rate limiting, and session timeout follow existing CMS policies and are out of scope for this feature.\n- Email is the unique identifier for a registered user account.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Existing CMS user registry with active accounts.\n- Existing credential verification capability and dashboard access controls.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The system redirects the user to the login page.\n\n## Extensions\n\n- **4a**: The email address is already registered.\n  - **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the email is already in use.\n- **5a**: The password does not meet security requirements.\n  - **5a1**: The system displays an error message describing the password constraints.\n- **6a**: A system or database error occurs.\n  - **6a1**: The system displays a registration failure message and logs the error.\n\n## Related Information\n\n- **Priority**: High\n- **Frequency**: High\n- **Open Issues**: Password security standards are not fully specified.\n\n# UC-01 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives\n\n## Main Success Scenario\n\nA user who does not yet have an account visits the Conference Management System website and chooses to register. The system responds by presenting a registration form requesting an email address and password. The user enters a valid, unique email address and a password that meets the system’s security requirements, then submits the form. The system verifies that the email address is correctly formatted and not already associated with an existing account. It also checks that the password satisfies the required security standards. After successful validation, the system creates a new user account and stores the user’s information securely in the database. The system then redirects the user to the login page, allowing the user to proceed with accessing CMS features.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 4a — Email Address Already Registered\n\nDuring registration, the user submits an email address that is already associated with an existing CMS account. When the system checks email uniqueness, it detects the conflict. The system rejects the registration attempt and displays an error message informing the user that the email address is already registered. The user remains on the registration page and is given the opportunity to correct the email address or abandon the registration process. No user account is created.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 5a — Password Does Not Meet Security Requirements\n\nThe user submits the registration form with a password that does not meet the CMS security standards. The system detects the violation during password validation. The registration process is halted, and the system displays an error message explaining the password requirements. The user remains on the registration page and may enter a new password that satisfies the constraints. No data is saved until a valid password is provided.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error\n\nAfter the user submits valid registration information, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to store the new account information in the database. The system aborts the registration process and displays a failure message indicating that registration could not be completed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The user account is not created, and the user may attempt to register again later.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Add file-backed user store (`data/users.json`) and model for user accounts.\\n2. Implement authentication service (email normalization, password verification, error paths).\\n3. Implement session service (create, validate, destroy session) and guard dashboard access.\\n4. Build login view and controller flow (form validation, error messages, redirect logic).\\n5. Add dashboard access gate and redirect logic for authenticated vs unauthenticated users.\\n6. Record login attempt outcomes and system errors to `logs/auth.log`.\\n7. Validate behavior against `UC-02-AT.md` scenarios.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/root/493-lab/Lab2\"}","call_id":"call_4BK5R5SCwimEWZMC4v0kytGs"}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions.

[Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established?

If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria?

[Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements?

[Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n"}]}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3).

See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\n\n## Summary\n\nEnable registered users to log in with email/password, receive clear user-safe error feedback, and access the dashboard only when authenticated. Implement a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS MVC flow with a lightweight server-side authentication controller, file-backed user store, and session handling aligned to UC-02 and UC-02-AT, with explicit credential-handling and non-plaintext requirements.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES2022); Node.js LTS runtime (no frameworks)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: None (built-in runtime modules only)  \n**Storage**: File-based user store (`data/users.json`) and in-memory session store  \n**Testing**: Manual acceptance tests per `UC-02-AT.md`  \n**Target Platform**: Modern desktop browsers; local Node.js runtime  \n**Project Type**: Web  \n**Performance Goals**: 95% of valid logins reach dashboard within 30 seconds; validation feedback is immediate (<1s perceived)  \n**Constraints**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; MVC separation; no external frameworks or build tools; no plaintext credential storage/transmission/logging  \n**Scale/Scope**: Single CMS login flow and dashboard access gate for a small user set (<1k accounts)\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-XX.md`\n- [x] Acceptance tests: relevant `UC-XX-AT.md` identified/updated\n- [x] MVC separation: model/view/controller boundaries planned\n- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-cms-login/\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nsrc/\n├── controllers/\n│   └── auth-controller.js\n├── models/\n│   ├── user-account.js\n│   └── login-attempt.js\n├── services/\n│   ├── auth-service.js\n│   ├── session-service.js\n│   └── user-store.js\n├── views/\n│   ├── login-view.js\n│   └── dashboard-view.js\n└── server.js\n\ndata/\n└── users.json\n\npublic/\n├── login.html\n├── dashboard.html\n└── assets/\n\nlogs/\n└── auth.log\n\ntests/\n└── acceptance/\n    └── uc-02.md\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Single web project with a lightweight server plus browser views. MVC separation is explicit via `models/`, `controllers/`, and `views/`, with `services/` for storage/session concerns.\n\n## Complexity Tracking\n\n> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**\n\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\n\n## Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n- Confirmed constraints: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; MVC separation required.\n- Resolved technical decisions in `research.md` (data store, sessions, hashing, logging, input normalization, user-safe error messaging).\n\n## Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n- Defined data entities and validation rules in `data-model.md`.\n- Auth and session endpoints documented in `contracts/login.yaml`.\n- Quickstart instructions captured in `quickstart.md`.\n- Agent context updated via `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`.\n\n## Constitution Check (Post-Design)\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: UC-02 referenced throughout plan artifacts\n- [x] Acceptance tests: UC-02-AT drives scenarios and contracts\n- [x] MVC separation: data-model + controllers/views/services delineated\n- [x] Vanilla stack: no frameworks or build tools introduced\n\n## Phase 2: Implementation Plan (High-Level)\n\n1. Add file-backed user store (`data/users.json`) and model for user accounts.\n2. Implement authentication service (email normalization, password verification, user-safe error paths, no plaintext handling).\n3. Implement session service (create, validate, destroy session) and guard dashboard access.\n4. Build login view and controller flow (form validation, error messages, redirect logic).\n5. Add dashboard access gate and redirect logic for authenticated vs unauthenticated users.\n6. Record login attempt outcomes and system errors to `logs/auth.log` without logging plaintext credentials.\n7. Validate behavior against `UC-02-AT.md` scenarios.\n"}}

Graceful handling of verification failures (Priority: P3)\n\nIf the system cannot verify credentials due to an internal issue, the user sees a failure message and can try again later.\n\n**Why this priority**: The login experience must fail safely and inform users when the system is unavailable.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a verification failure and confirming the user is not authenticated.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a system error during credential verification, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** a login failure message is shown and no dashboard access is granted.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the user submits the login form with a missing email or password?\n- How does the system handle repeated failed login attempts in a short period?\n- What happens when the authentication service is unavailable?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST accept login submissions only for registered user accounts.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate the user and grant access to the dashboard when valid credentials are provided.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST display an error indicating the account does not exist when the email is unregistered.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST display an error indicating credentials are invalid when the password is incorrect.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a login failure message when credential verification cannot be completed due to a system error.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST keep the user on the login page after a failed login and allow retry.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent dashboard access when authentication fails for any reason.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST record an internal error event when credential verification fails due to a system error.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user identity with email, credential record, and account status.\n- **Login Attempt**: A record of a submitted login with timestamp and outcome (success, invalid credentials, system error).\n- **Authenticated Session**: The active authenticated state that enables access to authorized CMS features during a visit.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of login attempts with valid credentials reach the dashboard within 30 seconds.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of failed login attempts display an error message and do not grant dashboard access.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of surveyed users rate the login experience as clear and easy.\n- **SC-004**: Support requests about login failures decrease by 25% within 60 days of release.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations\n\n### Credential Handling\n\n- User credentials MUST NOT be stored, logged, or transmitted in plaintext.\n- Passwords MUST be processed using a secure, one-way hashing algorithm with salting.\n- Password validation feedback MUST NOT reveal sensitive policy internals or echo user input.\n\n### Error Messaging\n\n- Error messages MUST be user-safe and non-technical.\n- Registration failures MUST NOT disclose internal system details, stack traces, or storage mechanisms.\n- Duplicate account attempts MUST return consistent messaging that does not enable account enumeration.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Account lockout rules, rate limiting, and session timeout follow existing CMS policies and are out of scope for this feature.\n- Email is the unique identifier for a registered user account.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Existing CMS user registry with active accounts.\n- Existing credential verification capability and dashboard access controls.\n"}}

May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All acceptance test updates for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Update acceptance tests for User Story 1 first:\nTask: \"Update/add acceptance tests in UC-XX-AT.md\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify acceptance criteria are defined before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\n\n## Summary\n\nEnable registered users to log in with email/password, receive clear user-safe error feedback, and access the dashboard only when authenticated. Implement a vanilla HTML/CSS/JS MVC flow with a lightweight server-side authentication controller, file-backed user store, and session handling aligned to UC-02 and UC-02-AT, with explicit credential-handling and non-plaintext requirements.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES2022); Node.js LTS runtime (no frameworks)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: None (built-in runtime modules only)  \n**Storage**: File-based user store (`data/users.json`) and in-memory session store  \n**Testing**: Manual acceptance tests per `UC-02-AT.md`  \n**Target Platform**: Modern desktop browsers; local Node.js runtime  \n**Project Type**: Web  \n**Performance Goals**: 95% of valid logins reach dashboard within 30 seconds; validation feedback is immediate (<1s perceived)  \n**Constraints**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; MVC separation; no external frameworks or build tools; no plaintext credential storage/transmission/logging  \n**Scale/Scope**: Single CMS login flow and dashboard access gate for a small user set (<1k accounts)\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-XX.md`\n- [x] Acceptance tests: relevant `UC-XX-AT.md` identified/updated\n- [x] MVC separation: model/view/controller boundaries planned\n- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-cms-login/\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nsrc/\n├── controllers/\n│   └── auth-controller.js\n├── models/\n│   ├── user-account.js\n│   └── login-attempt.js\n├── services/\n│   ├── auth-service.js\n│   ├── session-service.js\n│   └── user-store.js\n├── views/\n│   ├── login-view.js\n│   └── dashboard-view.js\n└── server.js\n\ndata/\n└── users.json\n\npublic/\n├── login.html\n├── dashboard.html\n└── assets/\n\nlogs/\n└── auth.log\n\ntests/\n└── acceptance/\n    └── uc-02.md\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Single web project with a lightweight server plus browser views. MVC separation is explicit via `models/`, `controllers/`, and `views/`, with `services/` for storage/session concerns.\n\n## Complexity Tracking\n\n> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**\n\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\n\n## Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n- Confirmed constraints: vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; MVC separation required.\n- Resolved technical decisions in `research.md` (data store, sessions, hashing, logging, input normalization, user-safe error messaging).\n\n## Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n- Defined data entities and validation rules in `data-model.md`.\n- Auth and session endpoints documented in `contracts/login.yaml`.\n- Quickstart instructions captured in `quickstart.md`.\n- Agent context updated via `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`.\n\n## Constitution Check (Post-Design)\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: UC-02 referenced throughout plan artifacts\n- [x] Acceptance tests: UC-02-AT drives scenarios and contracts\n- [x] MVC separation: data-model + controllers/views/services delineated\n- [x] Vanilla stack: no frameworks or build tools introduced\n\n## Phase 2: Implementation Plan (High-Level)\n\n1. Add file-backed user store (`data/users.json`) and model for user accounts.\n2. Implement authentication service (email normalization, password verification, user-safe error paths, no plaintext handling).\n3. Implement session service (create, validate, destroy session) and guard dashboard access.\n4. Build login view and controller flow (form validation, error messages, redirect logic).\n5. Add dashboard access gate and redirect logic for authenticated vs unauthenticated users.\n6. Record login attempt outcomes and system errors to `logs/auth.log` without logging plaintext credentials.\n7. Validate behavior against `UC-02-AT.md` scenarios.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Regenerate the CMS User Login spec for branch 001-cms-login mapped to UC-02 and UC-02-AT.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Add a mandatory Constitution Check section with explicit checkboxes for traceability, acceptance tests, MVC separation, and vanilla stack compliance. Populate User Scenarios & Testing with concrete scenarios that match the three user stories and include edge cases: missing email/password, repeated failed attempts (recording only, no lockout), and auth service unavailable. Fix security wording so it is login-scoped (authentication failures) and remove any registration/duplicate-account language from this login spec.\\\"\\n\\n## Constitution Check *(mandatory)*\\n\\n- [ ] Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-02.md`\\n- [ ] Acceptance tests identified in `UC-02-AT.md`\\n- [ ] MVC separation planned (model/view/controller boundaries)\\n- [ ] Vanilla stack compliance (HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks)\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Scenario A: Successful login and dashboard access\\n\\nA registered user enters a valid email and password on the login form and submits. The system authenticates the user, creates an authenticated session, and redirects the user to the dashboard. The user can access other authorized pages without re-authenticating during the same visit.\\n\\n### Scenario B: Unknown email\\n\\nA user submits the login form with an email that is not registered. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe error message indicating the account does not exist, and keeps the user on the login page.\\n\\n### Scenario C: Incorrect password\\n\\nA user submits the login form with a registered email and an incorrect password. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe error message indicating invalid credentials, and keeps the user on the login page.\\n\\n### Scenario D: Verification failure (system error)\\n\\nA user submits valid credentials but the system cannot verify them due to an internal error or authentication service outage. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe failure message, and records an internal error event. The user remains on the login page.\\n\\n### Scenario E: Missing required fields\\n\\nA user submits the login form with a missing email or password. The system blocks the attempt, displays a user-safe validation message, and does not attempt authentication.\\n\\n### Scenario F: Repeated failed attempts (recording only)\\n\\nA user makes multiple failed login attempts in a short period. The system records each failed attempt but does not lock the account or introduce additional barriers within this feature scope.\\n\\n### Scenario G: Authentication service unavailable\\n\\nThe authentication service is unavailable. The system does not authenticate the user, shows a user-safe failure message, and records an internal error event.\\n\\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\\n\\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-02\\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-02-AT\\n- **Notes**: Update existing UC-02 behavior for login flow, error handling, and edge cases.\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Access dashboard with valid credentials (Priority: P1)\\n\\nA registered user can enter their email and password to log in and reach their dashboard.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Logging in is the gateway to all authorized CMS features.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with a known valid account and verifying dashboard access.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a registered user with valid credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they are authenticated and taken to their dashboard.\\n2. **Given** a successful login, **When** the user navigates to another authorized CMS page during the same visit, **Then** access is granted without re-authenticating.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - See clear errors for invalid credentials (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA user who enters an unknown email or an incorrect password receives a clear error and remains on the login page.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Users need immediate feedback to correct mistakes and complete login.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to log in with an unregistered email and with a wrong password.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** an email that is not registered, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** an error indicates the account does not exist and the user stays on the login page.\\n2. **Given** a registered email with an incorrect password, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** an error indicates the credentials are invalid and the user stays on the login page.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Graceful handling of verification failures (Priority: P3)\\n\\nIf the system cannot verify credentials due to an internal issue, the user sees a failure message and can try again later.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: The login experience must fail safely and inform users when the system is unavailable.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a verification failure and confirming the user is not authenticated.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a system error during credential verification, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** a login failure message is shown and no dashboard access is granted.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- Missing email or password submission is blocked with a user-safe validation message.\\n- Repeated failed attempts are recorded, with no lockout or throttling in this feature scope.\\n- Authentication service unavailable results in a user-safe failure message and an internal error record.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login form that collects email and password.\\n- **FR-002**: System MUST accept login submissions only for registered user accounts.\\n- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate the user and grant access to the dashboard when valid credentials are provided.\\n- **FR-004**: System MUST display an error indicating the account does not exist when the email is unregistered.\\n- **FR-005**: System MUST display an error indicating credentials are invalid when the password is incorrect.\\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a user-safe login failure message when credential verification cannot be completed due to a system error or service outage.\\n- **FR-007**: System MUST keep the user on the login page after a failed login and allow retry.\\n- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent dashboard access when authentication fails for any reason.\\n- **FR-009**: System MUST record an internal error event when credential verification fails due to a system error or service outage.\\n- **FR-010**: System MUST validate missing email or password fields before attempting authentication.\\n- **FR-011**: System MUST record repeated failed login attempts without locking the account within this feature scope.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **User Account**: Registered user identity with email, credential record, and account status.\\n- **Login Attempt**: A record of a submitted login with timestamp and outcome (success, invalid credentials, system error).\\n- **Authenticated Session**: The active authenticated state that enables access to authorized CMS features during a visit.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of login attempts with valid credentials reach the dashboard within 30 seconds.\\n- **SC-002**: 100% of failed login attempts display a user-safe error message and do not grant dashboard access.\\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of surveyed users rate the login experience as clear and easy.\\n- **SC-004**: Support requests about login failures decrease by 25% within 60 days of release.\\n\\n## Security & Privacy Considerations\\n\\n### Credential Handling\\n\\n- User credentials MUST NOT be stored, logged, or transmitted in plaintext.\\n- Passwords MUST be processed using a secure, one-way hashing algorithm with salting.\\n- Password validation feedback MUST NOT reveal sensitive policy internals or echo user input.\\n\\n### Authentication Failure Messaging\\n\\n- Error messages MUST be user-safe and non-technical.\\n- Authentication failure messages MUST NOT disclose internal system details, stack traces, or storage mechanisms.\\n- Authentication failures MUST NOT enable account enumeration through inconsistent messaging.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- Account lockout rules, rate limiting, and session timeout follow existing CMS policies and are out of scope for this feature.\\n- Email is the unique identifier for a registered user account.\\n\\n## Dependencies\\n\\n- Existing CMS user registry with active accounts.\\n- Existing credential verification capability and dashboard access controls.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/root/493-lab/Lab2\"}","call_id":"call_GOnpzxyrR39IolfDdVgXPlyB"}}

Add a mandatory Constitution Check section with explicit checkboxes for traceability, acceptance tests, MVC separation, and vanilla stack compliance. Populate User Scenarios & Testing with concrete scenarios that match the three user stories and include edge cases: missing email/password, repeated failed attempts (recording only, no lockout), and auth service unavailable. Fix security wording so it is login-scoped (authentication failures) and remove any registration/duplicate-account language from this login spec.\"\n\n## Constitution Check *(mandatory)*\n\n- [ ] Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-02.md`\n- [ ] Acceptance tests identified in `UC-02-AT.md`\n- [ ] MVC separation planned (model/view/controller boundaries)\n- [ ] Vanilla stack compliance (HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks)\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### Scenario A: Successful login and dashboard access\n\nA registered user enters a valid email and password on the login form and submits. The system authenticates the user, creates an authenticated session, and redirects the user to the dashboard. The user can access other authorized pages without re-authenticating during the same visit.\n\n### Scenario B: Unknown email\n\nA user submits the login form with an email that is not registered. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe error message indicating the account does not exist, and keeps the user on the login page.\n\n### Scenario C: Incorrect password\n\nA user submits the login form with a registered email and an incorrect password. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe error message indicating invalid credentials, and keeps the user on the login page.\n\n### Scenario D: Verification failure (system error)\n\nA user submits valid credentials but the system cannot verify them due to an internal error or authentication service outage. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe failure message, and records an internal error event. The user remains on the login page.\n\n### Scenario E: Missing required fields\n\nA user submits the login form with a missing email or password. The system blocks the attempt, displays a user-safe validation message, and does not attempt authentication.\n\n### Scenario F: Repeated failed attempts (recording only)\n\nA user makes multiple failed login attempts in a short period. The system records each failed attempt but does not lock the account or introduce additional barriers within this feature scope.\n\n### Scenario G: Authentication service unavailable\n\nThe authentication service is unavailable. The system does not authenticate the user, shows a user-safe failure message, and records an internal error event.\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-02\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-02-AT\n- **Notes**: Update existing UC-02 behavior for login flow, error handling, and edge cases.\n\n### User Story 1 - Access dashboard with valid credentials (Priority: P1)\n\nA registered user can enter their email and password to log in and reach their dashboard.\n\n**Why this priority**: Logging in is the gateway to all authorized CMS features.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with a known valid account and verifying dashboard access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a registered user with valid credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they are authenticated and taken to their dashboard.\n2. **Given** a successful login, **When** the user navigates to another authorized CMS page during the same visit, **Then** access is granted without re-authenticating.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - See clear errors for invalid credentials (Priority: P2)\n\nA user who enters an unknown email or an incorrect password receives a clear error and remains on the login page.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need immediate feedback to correct mistakes and complete login.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to log in with an unregistered email and with a wrong password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an email that is not registered, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** an error indicates the account does not exist and the user stays on the login page.\n2. **Given** a registered email with an incorrect password, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** an error indicates the credentials are invalid and the user stays on the login page.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Graceful handling of verification failures (Priority: P3)\n\nIf the system cannot verify credentials due to an internal issue, the user sees a failure message and can try again later.\n\n**Why this priority**: The login experience must fail safely and inform users when the system is unavailable.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a verification failure and confirming the user is not authenticated.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a system error during credential verification, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** a login failure message is shown and no dashboard access is granted.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Missing email or password submission is blocked with a user-safe validation message.\n- Repeated failed attempts are recorded, with no lockout or throttling in this feature scope.\n- Authentication service unavailable results in a user-safe failure message and an internal error record.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST accept login submissions only for registered user accounts.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate the user and grant access to the dashboard when valid credentials are provided.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST display an error indicating the account does not exist when the email is unregistered.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST display an error indicating credentials are invalid when the password is incorrect.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a user-safe login failure message when credential verification cannot be completed due to a system error or service outage.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST keep the user on the login page after a failed login and allow retry.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent dashboard access when authentication fails for any reason.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST record an internal error event when credential verification fails due to a system error or service outage.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST validate missing email or password fields before attempting authentication.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST record repeated failed login attempts without locking the account within this feature scope.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user identity with email, credential record, and account status.\n- **Login Attempt**: A record of a submitted login with timestamp and outcome (success, invalid credentials, system error).\n- **Authenticated Session**: The active authenticated state that enables access to authorized CMS features during a visit.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of login attempts with valid credentials reach the dashboard within 30 seconds.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of failed login attempts display a user-safe error message and do not grant dashboard access.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of surveyed users rate the login experience as clear and easy.\n- **SC-004**: Support requests about login failures decrease by 25% within 60 days of release.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations\n\n### Credential Handling\n\n- User credentials MUST NOT be stored, logged, or transmitted in plaintext.\n- Passwords MUST be processed using a secure, one-way hashing algorithm with salting.\n- Password validation feedback MUST NOT reveal sensitive policy internals or echo user input.\n\n### Authentication Failure Messaging\n\n- Error messages MUST be user-safe and non-technical.\n- Authentication failure messages MUST NOT disclose internal system details, stack traces, or storage mechanisms.\n- Authentication failures MUST NOT enable account enumeration through inconsistent messaging.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Account lockout rules, rate limiting, and session timeout follow existing CMS policies and are out of scope for this feature.\n- Email is the unique identifier for a registered user account.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Existing CMS user registry with active accounts.\n- Existing credential verification capability and dashboard access controls.\n"}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d.

Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7.

List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3.

Add a note that these metrics are tracked through external product processes, not the login feature itself.` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"Update the Success Criteria section of the CMS User Login spec.

Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Add a mandatory Constitution Check section with explicit checkboxes for traceability, acceptance tests, MVC separation, and vanilla stack compliance. Populate User Scenarios & Testing with concrete scenarios that match the three user stories and include edge cases: missing email/password, repeated failed attempts (recording only, no lockout), and auth service unavailable. Fix security wording so it is login-scoped (authentication failures) and remove any registration/duplicate-account language from this login spec.\"\n     7\t\n     8\t## Constitution Check *(mandatory)*\n     9\t\n    10\t- [ ] Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-02.md`\n    11\t- [ ] Acceptance tests identified in `UC-02-AT.md`\n    12\t- [ ] MVC separation planned (model/view/controller boundaries)\n    13\t- [ ] Vanilla stack compliance (HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks)\n    14\t\n    15\t## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n    16\t\n    17\t### Scenario A: Successful login and dashboard access\n    18\t\n    19\tA registered user enters a valid email and password on the login form and submits. The system authenticates the user, creates an authenticated session, and redirects the user to the dashboard. The user can access other authorized pages without re-authenticating during the same visit.\n    20\t\n    21\t### Scenario B: Unknown email\n    22\t\n    23\tA user submits the login form with an email that is not registered. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe error message indicating the account does not exist, and keeps the user on the login page.\n    24\t\n    25\t### Scenario C: Incorrect password\n    26\t\n    27\tA user submits the login form with a registered email and an incorrect password. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe error message indicating invalid credentials, and keeps the user on the login page.\n    28\t\n    29\t### Scenario D: Verification failure (system error)\n    30\t\n    31\tA user submits valid credentials but the system cannot verify them due to an internal error or authentication service outage. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe failure message, and records an internal error event. The user remains on the login page.\n    32\t\n    33\t### Scenario E: Missing required fields\n    34\t\n    35\tA user submits the login form with a missing email or password. The system blocks the attempt, displays a user-safe validation message, and does not attempt authentication.\n    36\t\n    37\t### Scenario F: Repeated failed attempts (recording only)\n    38\t\n    39\tA user makes multiple failed login attempts in a short period. The system records each failed attempt but does not lock the account or introduce additional barriers within this feature scope.\n    40\t\n    41\t### Scenario G: Authentication service unavailable\n    42\t\n    43\tThe authentication service is unavailable. The system does not authenticate the user, shows a user-safe failure message, and records an internal error event.\n    44\t\n    45\t## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n    46\t\n    47\t- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-02\n    48\t- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-02-AT\n    49\t- **Notes**: Update existing UC-02 behavior for login flow, error handling, and edge cases.\n    50\t\n    51\t### User Story 1 - Access dashboard with valid credentials (Priority: P1)\n    52\t\n    53\tA registered user can enter their email and password to log in and reach their dashboard.\n    54\t\n    55\t**Why this priority**: Logging in is the gateway to all authorized CMS features.\n    56\t\n    57\t**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with a known valid account and verifying dashboard access.\n    58\t\n    59\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    60\t\n    61\t1. **Given** a registered user with valid credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they are authenticated and taken to their dashboard.\n    62\t2. **Given** a successful login, **When** the user navigates to another authorized CMS page during the same visit, **Then** access is granted without re-authenticating.\n    63\t\n    64\t---\n    65\t\n    66\t### User Story 2 - See clear errors for invalid credentials (Priority: P2)\n    67\t\n    68\tA user who enters an unknown email or an incorrect password receives a clear error and remains on the login page.\n    69\t\n    70\t**Why this priority**: Users need immediate feedback to correct mistakes and complete login.\n    71\t\n    72\t**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to log in with an unregistered email and with a wrong password.\n    73\t\n    74\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    75\t\n    76\t1. **Given** an email that is not registered, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** an error indicates the account does not exist and the user stays on the login page.\n    77\t2. **Given** an email that is not registered, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** a generic, user-safe message such as “Invalid email or password” is shown and the user stays on the login page.\n    78\t3. **Given** a registered email with an incorrect password, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** the same generic, user-safe message such as “Invalid email or password” is shown and the user stays on the login page.\n    79\t\n    80\t---\n    81\t\n    82\t### User Story 3 - Graceful handling of verification failures (Priority: P3)\n    83\t\n    84\tIf the system cannot verify credentials due to an internal issue, the user sees a failure message and can try again later.\n    85\t\n    86\t**Why this priority**: The login experience must fail safely and inform users when the system is unavailable.\n    87\t\n    88\t**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a verification failure and confirming the user is not authenticated.\n    89\t\n    90\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    91\t\n    92\t1. **Given** a system error during credential verification, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** a login failure message is shown and no dashboard access is granted.\n    93\t\n    94\t---\n    95\t\n    96\t### Edge Cases\n    97\t\n    98\t- Missing email or password submission is blocked with a user-safe validation message.\n    99\t- Repeated failed attempts are recorded, with no lockout or throttling in this feature scope.\n   100\t- Authentication service unavailable results in a user-safe failure message and an internal error record.\n   101\t\n   102\t## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n   103\t\n   104\t### Functional Requirements\n   105\t\n   106\t- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login form that collects email and password.\n   107\t- **FR-002**: System MUST accept login submissions only for registered user accounts.\n   108\t- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate the user and grant access to the dashboard when valid credentials are provided.\n   109\t- **FR-004**: System MUST display an error indicating the account does not exist when the email is unregistered.\n   110\t- **FR-005**: System MUST display an error indicating credentials are invalid when the password is incorrect.\n   111\t- **FR-006**: System MUST display a user-safe login failure message when credential verification cannot be completed due to a system error or service outage.\n   112\t- **FR-007**: System MUST keep the user on the login page after a failed login and allow retry.\n   113\t- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent dashboard access when authentication fails for any reason.\n   114\t- **FR-009**: System MUST record an internal error event when credential verification fails due to a system error or service outage.\n   115\t- **FR-010**: System MUST validate missing email or password fields before attempting authentication.\n   116\t- **FR-011**: System MUST record repeated failed login attempts without locking the account within this feature scope.\n   117\t\n   118\t### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n   119\t\n   120\t- **User Account**: Registered user identity with email, credential record, and account status.\n   121\t- **Login Attempt**: A record of a submitted login with timestamp and outcome (success, invalid credentials, system error).\n   122\t- **Authenticated Session**: The active authenticated state that enables access to authorized CMS features during a visit.\n   123\t\n   124\t## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n   125\t\n   126\t### Measurable Outcomes\n   127\t\n   128\t- **SC-001**: At least 95% of login attempts with valid credentials reach the dashboard within 30 seconds.\n   129\t- **SC-002**: 100% of failed login attempts display a user-safe error message and do not grant dashboard access.\n   130\t- **SC-003**: Post-release product metric (out of scope for this feature): At least 90% of surveyed users rate the login experience as clear and easy.\n   131\t- **SC-004**: Post-release product metric (out of scope for this feature): Support requests about login failures decrease by 25% within 60 days of release.\n   132\t\n   133\t**Note**: SC-003 and SC-004 are tracked via external product processes and are not implemented or instrumented by the login feature itself.\n   134\t\n   135\t## Security & Privacy Considerations\n   136\t\n   137\t### Credential Handling\n   138\t\n   139\t- User credentials MUST NOT be stored, logged, or transmitted in plaintext.\n   140\t- Passwords MUST be processed using a secure, one-way hashing algorithm with salting.\n   141\t- Password validation feedback MUST NOT reveal sensitive policy internals or echo user input.\n   142\t\n   143\t### Authentication Failure Messaging\n   144\t\n   145\t- Error messages MUST be user-safe and non-technical.\n   146\t- Authentication failure messages MUST NOT disclose internal system details, stack traces, or storage mechanisms.\n   147\t- Authentication failures MUST NOT enable account enumeration through inconsistent messaging.\n   148\t- Authentication failures for unknown email versus incorrect password MUST use consistent, non-enumerating messaging.\n   149\t\n   150\t## Assumptions\n   151\t\n   152\t- Account lockout rules, rate limiting, and session timeout follow existing CMS policies and are out of scope for this feature.\n   153\t- Email is the unique identifier for a registered user account.\n   154\t\n   155\t## Dependencies\n   156\t\n   157\t- Existing CMS user registry with active accounts.\n   158\t- Existing credential verification capability and dashboard access controls.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Add a mandatory Constitution Check section with explicit checkboxes for traceability, acceptance tests, MVC separation, and vanilla stack compliance. Populate User Scenarios & Testing with concrete scenarios that match the three user stories and include edge cases: missing email/password, repeated failed attempts (recording only, no lockout), and auth service unavailable. Fix security wording so it is login-scoped (authentication failures) and remove any registration/duplicate-account language from this login spec.\"\n\n## Constitution Check *(mandatory)*\n\n- [ ] Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-02.md`\n- [ ] Acceptance tests identified in `UC-02-AT.md`\n- [ ] MVC separation planned (model/view/controller boundaries)\n- [ ] Vanilla stack compliance (HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks)\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### Scenario A: Successful login and dashboard access\n\nA registered user enters a valid email and password on the login form and submits. The system authenticates the user, creates an authenticated session, and redirects the user to the dashboard. The user can access other authorized pages without re-authenticating during the same visit.\n\n### Scenario B: Unknown email\n\nA user submits the login form with an email that is not registered. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe error message indicating the account does not exist, and keeps the user on the login page.\n\n### Scenario C: Incorrect password\n\nA user submits the login form with a registered email and an incorrect password. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe error message indicating invalid credentials, and keeps the user on the login page.\n\n### Scenario D: Verification failure (system error)\n\nA user submits valid credentials but the system cannot verify them due to an internal error or authentication service outage. The system does not authenticate the user, displays a user-safe failure message, and records an internal error event. The user remains on the login page.\n\n### Scenario E: Missing required fields\n\nA user submits the login form with a missing email or password. The system blocks the attempt, displays a user-safe validation message, and does not attempt authentication.\n\n### Scenario F: Repeated failed attempts (recording only)\n\nA user makes multiple failed login attempts in a short period. The system records each failed attempt but does not lock the account or introduce additional barriers within this feature scope.\n\n### Scenario G: Authentication service unavailable\n\nThe authentication service is unavailable. The system does not authenticate the user, shows a user-safe failure message, and records an internal error event.\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-02\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-02-AT\n- **Notes**: Update existing UC-02 behavior for login flow, error handling, and edge cases.\n\n### User Story 1 - Access dashboard with valid credentials (Priority: P1)\n\nA registered user can enter their email and password to log in and reach their dashboard.\n\n**Why this priority**: Logging in is the gateway to all authorized CMS features.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in with a known valid account and verifying dashboard access.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a registered user with valid credentials, **When** they submit the login form, **Then** they are authenticated and taken to their dashboard.\n2. **Given** a successful login, **When** the user navigates to another authorized CMS page during the same visit, **Then** access is granted without re-authenticating.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - See clear errors for invalid credentials (Priority: P2)\n\nA user who enters an unknown email or an incorrect password receives a clear error and remains on the login page.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need immediate feedback to correct mistakes and complete login.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by attempting to log in with an unregistered email and with a wrong password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an email that is not registered, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** an error indicates the account does not exist and the user stays on the login page.\n2. **Given** an email that is not registered, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** a generic, user-safe message such as “Invalid email or password” is shown and the user stays on the login page.\n3. **Given** a registered email with an incorrect password, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** the same generic, user-safe message such as “Invalid email or password” is shown and the user stays on the login page.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Graceful handling of verification failures (Priority: P3)\n\nIf the system cannot verify credentials due to an internal issue, the user sees a failure message and can try again later.\n\n**Why this priority**: The login experience must fail safely and inform users when the system is unavailable.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating a verification failure and confirming the user is not authenticated.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a system error during credential verification, **When** the user submits the login form, **Then** a login failure message is shown and no dashboard access is granted.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Missing email or password submission is blocked with a user-safe validation message.\n- Repeated failed attempts are recorded, with no lockout or throttling in this feature scope.\n- Authentication service unavailable results in a user-safe failure message and an internal error record.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a login form that collects email and password.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST accept login submissions only for registered user accounts.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST authenticate the user and grant access to the dashboard when valid credentials are provided.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST display an error indicating the account does not exist when the email is unregistered.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST display an error indicating credentials are invalid when the password is incorrect.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a user-safe login failure message when credential verification cannot be completed due to a system error or service outage.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST keep the user on the login page after a failed login and allow retry.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST prevent dashboard access when authentication fails for any reason.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST record an internal error event when credential verification fails due to a system error or service outage.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST validate missing email or password fields before attempting authentication.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST record repeated failed login attempts without locking the account within this feature scope.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user identity with email, credential record, and account status.\n- **Login Attempt**: A record of a submitted login with timestamp and outcome (success, invalid credentials, system error).\n- **Authenticated Session**: The active authenticated state that enables access to authorized CMS features during a visit.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of login attempts with valid credentials reach the dashboard within 30 seconds.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of failed login attempts display a user-safe error message and do not grant dashboard access.\n- **SC-003**: Post-release product metric (out of scope for this feature): At least 90% of surveyed users rate the login experience as clear and easy.\n- **SC-004**: Post-release product metric (out of scope for this feature): Support requests about login failures decrease by 25% within 60 days of release.\n\n**Note**: SC-003 and SC-004 are tracked via external product processes and are not implemented or instrumented by the login feature itself.\n\n## Security & Privacy Considerations\n\n### Credential Handling\n\n- User credentials MUST NOT be stored, logged, or transmitted in plaintext.\n- Passwords MUST be processed using a secure, one-way hashing algorithm with salting.\n- Password validation feedback MUST NOT reveal sensitive policy internals or echo user input.\n\n### Authentication Failure Messaging\n\n- Error messages MUST be user-safe and non-technical.\n- Authentication failure messages MUST NOT disclose internal system details, stack traces, or storage mechanisms.\n- Authentication failures MUST NOT enable account enumeration through inconsistent messaging.\n- Authentication failures for unknown email versus incorrect password MUST use consistent, non-enumerating messaging.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- Account lockout rules, rate limiting, and session timeout follow existing CMS policies and are out of scope for this feature.\n- Email is the unique identifier for a registered user account.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Existing CMS user registry with active accounts.\n- Existing credential verification capability and dashboard access controls.\n"}}
