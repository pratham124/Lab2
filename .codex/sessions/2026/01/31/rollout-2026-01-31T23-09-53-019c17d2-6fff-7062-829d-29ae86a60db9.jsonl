You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"63cfe88fff269691cec0266c783138c31c8bd3fe","branch":"UC-03","repository_url":"https://github.com/pratham124/Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n The writable roots are `/root/493-lab/Lab2`, `/tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `UC-03.md` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c.

Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4.

Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-03.md\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-03.md\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-03.md\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

The system responds by displaying a password change form requesting the user’s current password and a new password. The user enters their current password along with a new password that meets the system’s security requirements and submits the form. The system verifies that the entered current password matches the password stored for the user’s account. It then validates the new password against the required security standards. After successful validation, the system updates the user’s password in the database and confirms that the password has been changed successfully. The user remains logged in and can continue using the system with the updated credentials.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 4a — Incorrect Current Password\n\nThe registered user attempts to change their password but enters an incorrect current password in the password change form. When the system verifies the current password against the stored credentials, the verification fails. The system rejects the password change request and displays an error message indicating that the current password is invalid. The user remains on the password change page and may re-enter the correct current password or abandon the process. The user’s password remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 5a — New Password Does Not Meet Security Requirements\n\nThe user submits the password change form with the correct current password but provides a new password that does not satisfy the CMS password security standards. During validation, the system detects that the new password is non-compliant. The system halts the password update process and displays an error message explaining the password requirements. The user remains on the password change page and may enter a new password that meets the required constraints. The existing password remains active.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error\n\nAfter the user submits valid password change information, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to update the password in the database. The system aborts the password change operation and displays a failure message indicating that the password could not be changed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The user’s password remains unchanged, and the user may attempt to change it again later.\n"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\\n\\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period?\\n- What happens if the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display?\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\\n- **SC-004**: Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/root/493-lab/Lab2\"}","call_id":"call_msHZqURy9DqG6fupYSwIu6zj"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3.

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period?\n- What happens if the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display?\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release.\n"}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period? (No lockout; retries allowed.)\n- What happens if the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display?\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-01\n\n- Q: How should repeated incorrect current-password attempts be handled? → A: No lockout; unlimited retries with error messages.\n- Q: What should happen to existing sessions after a password change? → A: Keep all sessions active (no session changes).\n- Q: Should the new password differ from password history? → A: Must differ from only the current password.\n- Q: Should users confirm the new password? → A: No confirmation field; new password entered once.\n- Q: How should validation errors be presented? → A: Inline error only (no summary).\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated incorrect current-password attempts without a temporary lockout, while displaying the error message each time.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST keep all existing user sessions active after a successful password change.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST accept a single new-password entry without requiring a confirmation field.\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display validation errors inline near the relevant field and MUST NOT show a separate summary.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]\"\n   - \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]\"\n   - \"Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]\"\n\n   Clarity:\n   - \"Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]\"\n   - \"Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]\"\n   - \"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n   Consistency:\n   - \"Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]\"\n   - \"Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]\"\n\n   Coverage:\n   - \"Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]\"\n   - \"Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:\n   - Focus areas selected\n   - Depth level\n   - Actor/timing\n   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated\n\n**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:\n\n- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)\n- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose\n- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder\n\nTo avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.\n\n## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items\n\n**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`\n\nSample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):\n\n- \"Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]\"\n- \"Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n- \"Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n- \"Is versioning strategy documented in requirements? [Gap]\"\n\n**Performance Requirements Quality:** `performance.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are performance requirements quantified with specific metrics? [Clarity]\"\n- \"Are performance targets defined for all critical user journeys? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are performance requirements under different load conditions specified? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Can performance requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability]\"\n- \"Are degradation requirements defined for high-load scenarios? [Edge Case, Gap]\"\n\n**Security Requirements Quality:** `security.md`\n\nSample items:\n\n- \"Are authentication requirements specified for all protected resources? [Coverage]\"\n- \"Are data protection requirements defined for sensitive information? [Completeness]\"\n- \"Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]\"\n- \"Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]\"\n- \"Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]\"\n\n## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do\n\n**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]\n```\n\n**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**\n\n```markdown\n- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]\n- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]\n- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]\n- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]\n- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]\n- [ ] CHK006 - Can \"visual hierarchy\" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]\n```\n\n**Key Differences:**\n\n- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly\n- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly\n- Wrong: Verification of behavior\n- Correct: Validation of requirement quality\n- Wrong: \"Does it do X?\"\n- Correct: \"Is X clearly specified?\"\n"}]}}

You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.\n\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.\n   - All file paths must be absolute.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:\n   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks\n   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content\n   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in ``\n   - Prefer precision over breadth\n\n   Generation algorithm:\n   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators (\"critical\", \"must\", \"compliance\"), stakeholder hints (\"QA\", \"review\", \"security team\"), and explicit deliverables (\"a11y\", \"rollback\", \"contracts\").\n   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.\n   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.\n   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.\n   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:\n      - Scope refinement (e.g., \"Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?\")\n      - Risk prioritization (e.g., \"Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?\")\n      - Depth calibration (e.g., \"Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?\")\n      - Audience framing (e.g., \"Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?\")\n      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., \"Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?\")\n      - Scenario class gap (e.g., \"No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?\")\n\n   Question formatting rules:\n   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters\n   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer\n   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said\n   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: \"Confirm whether X belongs in scope.\"\n\n   Defaults when interaction impossible:\n   - Depth: Standard\n   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise\n   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters\n\n   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., \"Unresolved recovery path risk\"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.\n\n3. **Understand user request**: Combine `` + clarifying answers:\n   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)\n   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user\n   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding\n   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)\n\n4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:\n   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope\n   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies\n   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks\n\n   **Context Loading Strategy**:\n   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)\n   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets\n   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected\n   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text\n\n5. **Generate checklist** - Create \"Unit Tests for Requirements\":\n   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist\n   - Generate unique checklist filename:\n     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)\n     - Format: `[domain].md`\n     - If file exists, append to existing file\n   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001\n   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)\n\n   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:\n   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:\n   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?\n   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?\n   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?\n   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?\n   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?\n\n   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:\n   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)\n   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)\n   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)\n   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)\n   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)\n   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)\n   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)\n   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)\n   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)\n\n   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - \"Unit Tests for English\"**:\n\n   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):\n   - \"Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards\"\n   - \"Test hover states work on desktop\"\n   - \"Confirm logo click navigates home\"\n\n   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):\n   - \"Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?\" [Clarity]\n   - \"Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?\" [Consistency]\n   - \"Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?\" [Coverage]\n   - \"Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?\" [Edge Cases]\n   - \"Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?\" [Completeness]\n   - \"Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?\" [Clarity]\n\n   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:\n   Each item should follow this pattern:\n   - Question format asking about requirement quality\n   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan\n   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]\n   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements\n   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements\n\n   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:\n\n   Completeness:\n   - \"Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]\"\n   - \"Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]\"\n   - \"Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]\"\n\n   Clarity:\n   - \"Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]\"\n   - \"Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]\"\n   - \"Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]\"\n\n   Consistency:\n   - \"Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]\"\n   - \"Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]\"\n\n   Coverage:\n   - \"Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]\"\n   - \"Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]\"\n   - \"Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]\"\n\n   Measurability:\n   - \"Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]\"\n   - \"Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]\"\n\n   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):\n   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios\n   - For each scenario class, ask: \"Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?\"\n   - If scenario class missing: \"Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]\"\n   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: \"Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Traceability Requirements**:\n   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference\n   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`\n   - If no ID system exists: \"Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]\"\n\n   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):\n   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:\n   - Ambiguities: \"Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]\"\n   - Conflicts: \"Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]\"\n   - Assumptions: \"Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]\"\n   - Dependencies: \"Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]\"\n   - Missing definitions: \"Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]\"\n\n   **Content Consolidation**:\n   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact\n   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect\n   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: \"Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]\"\n\n   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:\n   - ❌ Any item starting with \"Verify\", \"Test\", \"Confirm\", \"Check\" + implementation behavior\n   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior\n   - ❌ \"Displays correctly\", \"works properly\", \"functions as expected\"\n   - ❌ \"Click\", \"navigate\", \"render\", \"load\", \"execute\"\n   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures\n   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)\n\n   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:\n   - ✅ \"Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?\"\n   - ✅ \"Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?\"\n   - ✅ \"Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?\"\n   - ✅ \"Does the spec define [missing aspect]?\"\n\n6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.\n\n7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period? (No lockout; retries allowed.)\n- What happens if the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display?\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-01\n\n- Q: How should repeated incorrect current-password attempts be handled? → A: No lockout; unlimited retries with error messages.\n- Q: What should happen to existing sessions after a password change? → A: Keep all sessions active (no session changes).\n- Q: Should the new password differ from password history? → A: Must differ from only the current password.\n- Q: Should users confirm the new password? → A: No confirmation field; new password entered once.\n- Q: How should validation errors be presented? → A: Inline error only (no summary).\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated incorrect current-password attempts without a temporary lockout, while displaying the error message each time.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST keep all existing user sessions active after a successful password change.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST accept a single new-password entry without requiring a confirmation field.\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display validation errors inline near the relevant field and MUST NOT show a separate summary.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period? (No lockout; retries allowed.)\n- What happens if the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display?\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-01\n\n- Q: How should repeated incorrect current-password attempts be handled? → A: No lockout; unlimited retries with error messages.\n- Q: What should happen to existing sessions after a password change? → A: Keep all sessions active (no session changes).\n- Q: Should the new password differ from password history? → A: Must differ from only the current password.\n- Q: Should users confirm the new password? → A: No confirmation field; new password entered once.\n- Q: How should validation errors be presented? → A: Inline error only (no summary).\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated incorrect current-password attempts without a temporary lockout, while displaying the error message each time.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST keep all existing user sessions active after a successful password change.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST accept a single new-password entry without requiring a confirmation field.\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display validation errors inline near the relevant field and MUST NOT show a separate summary.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Implement within the CMS MVC structure using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, aligned to UC-03 and the canonical acceptance test document UC-03-AT.md. The password change request operates on the currently authenticated user and does not require a userId in the request body.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla web stack only)  \n**Storage**: Existing CMS user account data store (implementation unchanged)  \n**Testing**: Acceptance tests are defined exclusively in UC-03-AT.md (canonical); no alternative acceptance test naming or locations  \n**Target Platform**: Web browser + CMS server  \n**Project Type**: Web  \n**Performance Goals**: 95% of successful changes complete within 2 minutes (SC-001)  \n**Constraints**: MVC separation (views render presentation only; validation and business logic live in controllers/services); vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; keep all sessions active after change; no lockout or rate-based blocking for repeated incorrect current-password attempts  \n**Scale/Scope**: Single CMS instance; typical conference user volume (not explicitly specified)\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-03.md`\n- [x] Acceptance tests: canonical document is `UC-03-AT.md` (no alternative naming)\n- [x] MVC separation: views render presentation only; validation/business logic in controllers/services\n- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-change-password/\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nsrc/\n├── models/\n├── controllers/\n├── views/\n└── services/\n\ntests/\n└── acceptance/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Web MVC layout with models/controllers/views in `src/`.

Technical decisions follow the CMS constitution (MVC + vanilla stack) and the feature spec clarifications.\n\n### Output: `research.md`\n\n- Documented the stack constraints, canonical acceptance test source, session behavior, and contract approach derived from the constitution and spec.\n\n## Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n### Data Model\n\n- Extracted entities and validation rules into `data-model.md` with explicit session and request context.\n\n### API Contracts\n\n- Defined REST-style contract for password change in `/contracts/openapi.yaml` using the authenticated user context (no userId in request).\n\n### Quickstart\n\n- Added `quickstart.md` with manual validation steps tied to UC-03-AT.md.\n\n### Agent Context Update\n\n- Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex` to sync plan context.\n\n## Constitution Check (Post-Design)\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: UC-03 referenced in spec and plan\n- [x] Acceptance tests: canonical UC-03-AT.md referenced (no alternative names)\n- [x] MVC separation: views render presentation only; validation/business logic in controllers/services\n- [x] Vanilla stack: no frameworks or build tools introduced\n"}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period? (No lockout; retries allowed.)\n- What happens if the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display?\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-01\n\n- Q: How should repeated incorrect current-password attempts be handled? → A: No lockout; unlimited retries with error messages.\n- Q: What should happen to existing sessions after a password change? → A: Keep all sessions active (no session changes).\n- Q: Should the new password differ from password history? → A: Must differ from only the current password.\n- Q: Should users confirm the new password? → A: No confirmation field; new password entered once.\n- Q: How should validation errors be presented? → A: Inline error only (no summary).\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated incorrect current-password attempts without a temporary lockout, while displaying the error message each time.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST keep all existing user sessions active after a successful password change.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST accept a single new-password entry without requiring a confirmation field.\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display validation errors inline near the relevant field and MUST NOT show a separate summary.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release.\n"}}

Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All acceptance test updates for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Update acceptance tests for User Story 1 first:\nTask: \"Update/add acceptance tests in UC-XX-AT.md\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify acceptance criteria are defined before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period? (No lockout; retries allowed.)\n- What happens if the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display?\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-01\n\n- Q: How should repeated incorrect current-password attempts be handled? → A: No lockout; unlimited retries with error messages.\n- Q: What should happen to existing sessions after a password change? → A: Keep all sessions active (no session changes).\n- Q: Should the new password differ from password history? → A: Must differ from only the current password.\n- Q: Should users confirm the new password? → A: No confirmation field; new password entered once.\n- Q: How should validation errors be presented? → A: Inline error only (no summary).\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated incorrect current-password attempts without a temporary lockout, while displaying the error message each time.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST keep all existing user sessions active after a successful password change.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST accept a single new-password entry without requiring a confirmation field.\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display validation errors inline near the relevant field and MUST NOT show a separate summary.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release.\n"}}

Implement within the CMS MVC structure using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, aligned to UC-03 and the canonical acceptance test document UC-03-AT.md. The password change request operates on the currently authenticated user and does not require a userId in the request body.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla web stack only)  \n**Storage**: Existing CMS user account data store (implementation unchanged)  \n**Testing**: Acceptance tests are defined exclusively in UC-03-AT.md (canonical); no alternative acceptance test naming or locations  \n**Target Platform**: Web browser + CMS server  \n**Project Type**: Web  \n**Performance Goals**: 95% of successful changes complete within 2 minutes (SC-001)  \n**Constraints**: MVC separation (views render presentation only; validation and business logic live in controllers/services); vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; keep all sessions active after change; no lockout or rate-based blocking for repeated incorrect current-password attempts  \n**Scale/Scope**: Single CMS instance; typical conference user volume (not explicitly specified)\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research.

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period? (No lockout; retries allowed.)\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-01\n\n- Q: How should repeated incorrect current-password attempts be handled? → A: No lockout; unlimited retries with error messages.\n- Q: What should happen to existing sessions after a password change? → A: Keep all sessions active (no session changes).\n- Q: Should the new password differ from password history? → A: Must differ from only the current password.\n- Q: Should users confirm the new password? → A: No confirmation field; new password entered once.\n- Q: How should validation errors be presented? → A: Inline error only (no summary).\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n- Handling cases where the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated incorrect current-password attempts without a temporary lockout, while displaying the error message each time.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST keep all existing user sessions active after a successful password change.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST accept a single new-password entry without requiring a confirmation field.\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display validation errors inline near the relevant field and MUST NOT show a separate summary.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: Post-release metric (external user survey): At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Post-release metric (support analytics): Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release compared to the 60-day pre-release baseline from support ticketing reports.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Implement within the CMS MVC structure using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, aligned to UC-03 and the canonical acceptance test document UC-03-AT.md.

Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-03.md`\n- [x] Acceptance tests: canonical document is `UC-03-AT.md` (no alternative naming)\n- [x] MVC separation: views render presentation only; validation/business logic in controllers/services\n- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-change-password/\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nsrc/\n├── models/\n├── controllers/\n├── views/\n└── services/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Web MVC layout with models/controllers/views in `src/`. Acceptance tests are defined only in `UC-03-AT.md` and referenced from documentation; no alternative acceptance test filenames or folders.\n\n## Complexity Tracking\n\n> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**\n\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\n| None | N/A | N/A |\n\n## Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n### Research Tasks\n\nNo open research items. Technical decisions follow the CMS constitution (MVC + vanilla stack) and the feature spec clarifications.\n\n### Output: `research.md`\n\n- Documented the stack constraints, canonical acceptance test source, session behavior, and contract approach derived from the constitution and spec.\n\n## Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n### Data Model\n\n- Extracted entities and validation rules into `data-model.md` with explicit session and request context.\n\n### API Contracts\n\n- Defined REST-style contract for password change in `/contracts/openapi.yaml` using the authenticated user context (no userId in request).\n\n### Quickstart\n\n- Added `quickstart.md` with manual validation steps tied to UC-03-AT.md.\n\n### Agent Context Update\n\n- Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex` to sync plan context.\n\n## Constitution Check (Post-Design)\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: UC-03 referenced in spec and plan\n- [x] Acceptance tests: canonical UC-03-AT.md referenced (no alternative names)\n- [x] MVC separation: views render presentation only; validation/business logic in controllers/services\n- [x] Vanilla stack: no frameworks or build tools introduced\n"}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period?

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D.

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5.

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period?

Implement within the CMS MVC structure using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, aligned to UC-03 and the canonical acceptance test document UC-03-AT.md. The password change request operates on the currently authenticated user and does not require a userId in the request body.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla web stack only)  \n**Storage**: Existing CMS user account data store (implementation unchanged)  \n**Testing**: Acceptance tests are defined exclusively in UC-03-AT.md (canonical); no alternative acceptance test naming or locations  \n**Target Platform**: Web browser + CMS server  \n**Project Type**: Web  \n**Performance Goals**: 95% of successful changes complete within 2 minutes (SC-001)  \n**Constraints**: MVC separation (views render presentation only; validation and business logic live in controllers/services); vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; keep all sessions active after change; no lockout or rate-based blocking for repeated incorrect current-password attempts  \n**Scale/Scope**: Single CMS instance; typical conference user volume (not explicitly specified)\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-03.md`\n- [x] Acceptance tests: canonical document is `UC-03-AT.md` (no alternative naming)\n- [x] MVC separation: views render presentation only; validation/business logic in controllers/services\n- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-change-password/\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nsrc/\n├── models/\n├── controllers/\n├── views/\n└── services/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Web MVC layout with models/controllers/views in `src/`.

Technical decisions follow the CMS constitution (MVC + vanilla stack) and the feature spec clarifications.\n\n### Output: `research.md`\n\n- Documented the stack constraints, canonical acceptance test source, session behavior, and contract approach derived from the constitution and spec.\n\n## Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n### Data Model\n\n- Extracted entities and validation rules into `data-model.md` with explicit session and request context.\n\n### API Contracts\n\n- Defined REST-style contract for password change in `/contracts/openapi.yaml` using the authenticated user context (no userId in request).\n\n### Quickstart\n\n- Added `quickstart.md` with manual validation steps tied to UC-03-AT.md.\n\n### Agent Context Update\n\n- Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex` to sync plan context.\n\n## Constitution Check (Post-Design)\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: UC-03 referenced in spec and plan\n- [x] Acceptance tests: canonical UC-03-AT.md referenced (no alternative names)\n- [x] MVC separation: views render presentation only; validation/business logic in controllers/services\n- [x] Vanilla stack: no frameworks or build tools introduced\n"}}

Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period? (No lockout; retries allowed.)\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-01\n\n- Q: How should repeated incorrect current-password attempts be handled? → A: No lockout; unlimited retries with error messages.\n- Q: What should happen to existing sessions after a password change? → A: Keep all sessions active (no session changes).\n- Q: Should the new password differ from password history? → A: Must differ from only the current password.\n- Q: Should users confirm the new password? → A: No confirmation field; new password entered once.\n- Q: How should validation errors be presented? → A: Inline error only (no summary).\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n- Handling cases where the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated incorrect current-password attempts without a temporary lockout, while displaying the error message each time.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST keep all existing user sessions active after a successful password change.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST accept a single new-password entry without requiring a confirmation field.\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display validation errors inline near the relevant field and MUST NOT show a separate summary.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: Post-release metric (external user survey): At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Post-release metric (support analytics): Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release compared to the 60-day pre-release baseline from support ticketing reports.\n"}}

Implement within the CMS MVC structure using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, aligned to UC-03 and the canonical acceptance test document UC-03-AT.md. The password change request operates on the currently authenticated user and does not require a userId in the request body.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla web stack only)  \n**Storage**: Existing CMS user account data store (implementation unchanged)  \n**Testing**: Acceptance tests are defined exclusively in UC-03-AT.md (canonical); no alternative acceptance test naming or locations  \n**Target Platform**: Web browser + CMS server  \n**Project Type**: Web  \n**Performance Goals**: 95% of successful changes complete within 2 minutes (SC-001)  \n**Constraints**: MVC separation (views render presentation only; validation and business logic live in controllers/services); vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; keep all sessions active after change; no lockout or rate-based blocking for repeated incorrect current-password attempts  \n**Scale/Scope**: Single CMS instance; typical conference user volume (not explicitly specified)\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-03.md`\n- [x] Acceptance tests: canonical document is `UC-03-AT.md` (no alternative naming)\n- [x] MVC separation: views render presentation only; validation/business logic in controllers/services\n- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-change-password/\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nsrc/\n├── models/\n├── controllers/\n├── views/\n└── services/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Web MVC layout with models/controllers/views in `src/`.

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Assumptions: user remains logged in after a successful change; password policy is minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and must differ from the current password. Session behavior: all existing sessions remain active after password change. Password history: new password must differ from the current password only.\n\n### User Story 1 - Change Password Successfully (Priority: P1)\n\nA logged-in user updates their account password from account settings and receives confirmation that the change succeeded.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core security-maintenance task and primary user goal.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a password with valid inputs and verifying the user can continue using the system.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in registered user, **When** they submit the change-password form with the correct current password and a policy-compliant new password, **Then** the system updates the password and confirms success.\n2. **Given** a successful password change, **When** the user continues their session, **Then** they remain logged in and can access account features.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Correct Invalid Password Inputs (Priority: P2)\n\nA logged-in user receives clear guidance when the current password is incorrect or the new password does not meet policy, and can correct the input.\n\n**Why this priority**: Clear errors prevent lockouts and reduce support load while maintaining security.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by submitting invalid inputs and verifying the correct error messages appear without changing the password.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter an incorrect current password, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays an error explaining the current password is invalid.\n2. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they enter a new password that fails policy, **Then** the system rejects the change and displays the policy requirements.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Update Failures Gracefully (Priority: P3)\n\nA logged-in user is informed when a system error prevents a password change and their existing password remains active.\n\n**Why this priority**: Users need clear feedback and safety when the system cannot complete the change.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating a backend failure and verifying the user sees a failure message and the password is unchanged.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a logged-in user with valid inputs, **When** a system error occurs during update, **Then** the system displays a failure message and the existing password remains in effect.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the new password matches the current password?\n- How does the system handle repeated incorrect current-password attempts in a short period? (No lockout; retries allowed.)\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-01\n\n- Q: How should repeated incorrect current-password attempts be handled? → A: No lockout; unlimited retries with error messages.\n- Q: What should happen to existing sessions after a password change? → A: Keep all sessions active (no session changes).\n- Q: Should the new password differ from password history? → A: Must differ from only the current password.\n- Q: Should users confirm the new password? → A: No confirmation field; new password entered once.\n- Q: How should validation errors be presented? → A: Inline error only (no summary).\n\n## Out of Scope\n\n- Password reset or recovery for logged-out users\n- Administrator-initiated password changes\n- Changes to multi-factor authentication settings\n- Handling cases where the password update succeeds but the confirmation message fails to display\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow logged-in registered users to access a change-password form from account settings.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST require the current password and a new password to submit a change request.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST verify the current password matches the stored credentials before changing it.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST validate the new password against the CMS password policy: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 letter and 1 number, and different from the current password.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST update the user’s password when validation succeeds and confirm success to the user.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST reject changes with incorrect current passwords and show a clear error message.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes with non-compliant new passwords and display the policy requirements.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve the user’s existing password if a system error occurs and display a failure message.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST keep the user logged in after a successful password change.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST allow repeated incorrect current-password attempts without a temporary lockout, while displaying the error message each time.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST keep all existing user sessions active after a successful password change.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST accept a single new-password entry without requiring a confirmation field.\n- **FR-013**: System MUST display validation errors inline near the relevant field and MUST NOT show a separate summary.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **User Account**: Registered user profile with authentication credentials and account settings access.\n- **Password Policy**: The set of rules used to validate new passwords.\n- **Password Change Request**: User-initiated request containing current password and proposed new password.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful password changes are completed by users in under 2 minutes from opening account settings.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of attempts with an incorrect current password are rejected and display an error message.\n- **SC-003**: Post-release metric (external user survey): At least 90% of users who enter a non-compliant new password can correct it and succeed within two attempts.\n- **SC-004**: Post-release metric (support analytics): Support tickets related to password change failures decrease by 30% within 60 days of release compared to the 60-day pre-release baseline from support ticketing reports.\n"}}

Implement within the CMS MVC structure using vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, aligned to UC-03 and the canonical acceptance test document UC-03-AT.md. The password change request operates on the currently authenticated user and does not require a userId in the request body.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla web stack only)  \n**Storage**: Existing CMS user account data store (implementation unchanged)  \n**Testing**: Acceptance tests are defined exclusively in UC-03-AT.md (canonical); no alternative acceptance test naming or locations  \n**Target Platform**: Web browser + CMS server  \n**Project Type**: Web  \n**Performance Goals**: 95% of successful changes complete within 2 minutes (SC-001)  \n**Constraints**: MVC separation (views render presentation only; validation and business logic live in controllers/services); vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only; keep all sessions active after change; no lockout or rate-based blocking for repeated incorrect current-password attempts  \n**Scale/Scope**: Single CMS instance; typical conference user volume (not explicitly specified)\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-03.md`\n- [x] Acceptance tests: canonical document is `UC-03-AT.md` (no alternative naming)\n- [x] MVC separation: views render presentation only; validation/business logic in controllers/services\n- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-change-password/\n├── plan.md              # This file (/speckit.plan command output)\n├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/speckit.plan command)\n└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/speckit.tasks command - NOT created by /speckit.plan)\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\nsrc/\n├── models/\n├── controllers/\n├── views/\n└── services/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Web MVC layout with models/controllers/views in `src/`.

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}
