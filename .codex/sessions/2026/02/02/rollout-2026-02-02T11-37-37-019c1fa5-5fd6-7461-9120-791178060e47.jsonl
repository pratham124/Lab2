You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"63cfe88fff269691cec0266c783138c31c8bd3fe","branch":"UC-11","repository_url":"https://github.com/pratham124/Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n The writable roots are `/root/493-lab/Lab2`, `/tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The reviewer selects one of the assigned papers and is presented with the corresponding review form. The reviewer completes all required sections of the form, providing evaluations and comments as requested. After completing the form, the reviewer submits it. The system validates that all required fields are completed and that the entered data is valid. Upon successful validation, the system stores the completed review in the database and confirms that the review has been submitted successfully. The submitted review is then made available to the editor for assessment as part of the paper decision process.\nUC-13.md:63:The reviewer opens the review form for an assigned paper but submits the form without completing all required fields or with invalid input. During validation, the system detects the missing or invalid information. The system rejects the submission and displays an error message indicating which fields must be corrected. The reviewer remains on the review form page and may complete or correct the required fields before attempting to submit the review again. The review is not stored.\nUC-13.md:69:After the reviewer submits a fully completed and valid review form, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to store the review in the database. The system aborts the submission process and displays a failure message indicating that the review could not be submitted at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The reviewer’s review is not saved, and the reviewer may attempt to submit the review again later.\nUC-13.md:75:The reviewer attempts to submit a review for a paper that is not assigned to them, either by accessing an invalid link or by attempting to manipulate the submission process. The system detects that the reviewer is not authorized to submit a review for the selected paper. The system denies the submission and displays an authorization error message.

The system creates a review invitation for the reviewer and sends a notification to the reviewer using the contact information associated with their account. The reviewer receives the invitation and later logs in to the CMS. Upon accessing their dashboard or list of review tasks, the reviewer sees the pending review invitation. The system displays the details of the invitation along with clear options to accept or reject the review request. The reviewer is now able to respond to the invitation according to their availability.\nUC-11.md:60:The editor assigns the reviewer to a paper, and the system successfully creates the review invitation. However, the system fails to send the notification to the reviewer due to a temporary issue with the notification service. The failure is logged by the system for administrative review. Despite the notification failure, the review invitation remains stored in the CMS. When the reviewer later logs in and accesses their review invitations, the system displays the pending invitation normally.\nUC-11.md:66:After the system sends the review invitation, the reviewer does not log in to the CMS immediately. The invitation remains in a pending state in the system. At a later time, when the reviewer logs in and navigates to their review invitations, the system displays the pending invitation. The reviewer can then choose to accept or reject the review request without any loss of information.\nUC-11.md:72:The reviewer logs in to the CMS and navigates to the list of review invitations. When the system attempts to retrieve the invitation information from the database, an internal system or database error occurs. The system is unable to display the invitation and instead shows an error message indicating that the invitation cannot be displayed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the reviewer may attempt to view the invitation again later.\nUC-09.md:3:**Goal in Context**: Prevent an editor from assigning more than the maximum allowed number of papers to a reviewer in order to ensure fair and balanced reviewer workload.\nUC-09.md:8:**Trigger**: The editor attempts to assign a reviewer to a paper during the reviewer assignment process.\nUC-09.md:12:- The system prevents any reviewer from being assigned more than five papers, and only valid reviewer assignments are allowed.\nUC-09.md:16:- The system allows a reviewer to be assigned more than five papers, resulting in an unbalanced workload.\nUC-09.md:21:- The reviewer assignment process is in progress.\nUC-09.md:27:1.

The system informs the editor that the reviewer has reached the maximum workload limit.\nUC-09.md:36:- **3a**: The reviewer has fewer than five assigned papers.\nUC-09.md:51:An editor who is logged into the Conference Management System is in the process of assigning reviewers to a submitted paper. The editor selects a reviewer to assign to the paper. The system checks the number of papers currently assigned to the selected reviewer and determines that the reviewer has already reached the maximum allowed workload of five papers. As a result, the system prevents the assignment from being completed. The system displays a message informing the editor that the selected reviewer cannot be assigned additional papers because the workload limit has been reached. The reviewer assignment is not saved, ensuring that reviewer workloads remain balanced.\nUC-09.md:57:The editor selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, and the system checks the reviewer’s current workload. The system determines that the reviewer has fewer than five assigned papers. Since assigning the paper would not exceed the workload limit, the system allows the assignment to proceed. The reviewer is successfully assigned to the paper, and the editor can continue with the reviewer assignment process.\nUC-09.md:63:The editor selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, but the system encounters an error while attempting to retrieve the reviewer’s workload information from the database. Because the system cannot verify whether the assignment would exceed the workload limit, it blocks the assignment to prevent potential overload. The system displays an error message indicating that the reviewer workload cannot be verified at this time and logs the error for administrative review. The editor may attempt the assignment again later.\nUC-06-AT.md:8:**Out of Scope**: Final submission behavior (UC-04), manuscript upload specifics (UC-05), editorial review workflow.\nUC-08-AT.md:6:**Objective**: Verify that an editor can assign reviewers to a submitted paper according to conference rules, that invitations are issued, and that rule violations and failures are handled correctly.  \nUC-08-AT.md:7:**In Scope**: Reviewer selection UI/workflow, validation of required reviewer count, workload limit enforcement, persistence of assignments, notification/invitation sending, error handling, access control.  \nUC-08-AT.md:8:**Out of Scope**: Reviewer acceptance/rejection of invitations (separate use case), conflict-of-interest checks and expertise matching rules beyond what is implemented.\nUC-08-AT.md:12:- Each submitted paper must be assigned **exactly 3** reviewers.\nUC-08-AT.md:13:- Each reviewer must have **no more than 5** assigned papers.\nUC-08-AT.md:23:- Submitted paper `P1` exists and is in a state requiring reviewer assignment.\nUC-08-AT.md:24:- At least 3 eligible reviewers exist: `R1`, `R2`, `R3`.\nUC-08-AT.md:25:- Each selected reviewer currently has <= 4 assigned papers.\nUC-08-AT.md:37:3.

The editor selects the paper, and the system displays a list of eligible reviewers. Based on the reviewers’ expertise and availability, the editor selects the required number of reviewers for the paper. The system validates that the selected reviewers satisfy conference rules, including workload limits. After successful validation, the system assigns the reviewers to the paper and records the assignments in the database. The system then sends review invitations to the selected reviewers and confirms to the editor that the reviewers have been assigned successfully.\nUC-08.md:61:The editor selects a number of reviewers that is fewer or greater than the required number for a paper. When the system validates the selection, it detects that the number of reviewers does not meet conference rules. The system rejects the assignment attempt and displays an error message indicating the required number of reviewers. The editor remains on the reviewer selection interface and may adjust the selection to meet the requirement. No reviewer assignments are saved.\nUC-08.md:67:The editor selects reviewers for the paper, but one or more of the selected reviewers has already reached the maximum allowed number of assigned papers. During validation, the system detects the workload violation. The system rejects the assignment and displays an error message identifying the workload issue. The editor may choose a different reviewer or modify the selection. No assignments are saved.\nUC-08.md:73:After the editor selects a valid set of reviewers, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to save the reviewer assignments in the database. The assignment process is aborted, and the system displays a failure message indicating that the reviewers could not be assigned at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The paper remains unassigned, and the editor may attempt the assignment again later.\nUC-04.md:3:**Goal in Context**: Allow an author to submit a paper manuscript along with required metadata so that the paper can enter the conference review process.\nUC-04.md:12:- The paper manuscript and all required metadata are successfully stored in the CMS database and the paper is marked as submitted for review.\nUC-04.md:53:An author who is logged into the Conference Management System decides to submit a paper for review. The author navigates to the paper submission section, where the system displays a submission form requesting paper metadata and a manuscript file. The author enters all required metadata, including authors’ names, affiliations, contact information, abstract, and keywords. The author then uploads the paper manuscript in an accepted file format and submits the form. The system validates that all required fields are completed and that the uploaded manuscript meets the submission constraints. After successful validation, the system stores the paper metadata and manuscript in the database and marks the paper as submitted for review. The system confirms the successful submission and redirects the author to their home page.\nUC-04.md:71:After the author submits valid metadata and a valid manuscript file, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to store the paper information in the database. The submission process is aborted, and the system displays a failure message indicating that the paper could not be submitted at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The paper is not marked as submitted, and the author may attempt the submission again later.\nUC-10.md:3:**Goal in Context**: Inform the editor when a reviewer assignment violates conference rules so the editor can correct the assignment before it is saved.\nUC-10.md:8:**Trigger**: The editor attempts to save a reviewer assignment that violates an assignment rule.\nUC-10.md:21:- The editor is performing reviewer assignment for a submitted paper.\nUC-10.md:26:1. The editor selects a paper for reviewer assignment.\nUC-10.md:27:2. The editor selects reviewers and attempts to save the assignment.\nUC-10.md:50:An editor who is logged into the Conference Management System is assigning reviewers to a submitted paper. After selecting the reviewers, the editor attempts to save the assignment. The system automatically validates the assignment against the conference rules, such as the required number of reviewers and reviewer workload limits. During validation, the system detects that the assignment violates one or more rules. The system blocks the assignment from being saved and immediately displays a clear notification to the editor describing the specific rule violation. The editor is informed of the issue and can modify the assignment to correct the violation before attempting to save again.\nUC-10.md:56:While attempting to save a reviewer assignment, the editor selects reviewers in a way that violates more than one assignment rule, such as selecting too many reviewers and including a reviewer who has exceeded the workload limit. When the system performs validation, it detects multiple rule violations. The system blocks the assignment and displays notifications describing each violation individually. This allows the editor to clearly understand all issues that must be corrected before the assignment can be saved. No reviewer assignments are stored until all violations are resolved.\nUC-10.md:62:The editor selects reviewers and attempts to save the assignment. During the validation process, the system encounters an internal error or is unable to access required data needed to validate the assignment rules. Because the system cannot reliably determine whether the assignment is valid, it blocks the assignment from being saved. The system displays an error message informing the editor that assignment validation could not be completed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the editor may attempt the assignment again later.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The list is ordered newest first and is usable with keyboard-only navigation. The reviewer can locate an invitation quickly and understands its status.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: The invitation list is the core entry point for reviewers to understand assignments and deadlines.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in as a reviewer with invitations and validating list display, ordering, pagination, and keyboard access without any notification dependencies.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a reviewer with multiple invitations, **When** they open the invitations list, **Then** each item shows paper title, status, and response due date.\\n2. **Given** more than 20 invitations, **When** the reviewer opens the list, **Then** the newest invitations appear first and pagination controls are available to access older items.\\n3. **Given** a keyboard-only user, **When** they navigate the list and its actions, **Then** all list items and actions are reachable and operable without a mouse.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - Receive and recognize invitation notifications (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA reviewer receives a review invitation notification that clearly states the paper title, that they have been assigned, and that they should log in to respond. The invitation becomes visible in the list within one minute of assignment, regardless of notification delivery timing.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Clear notification content and timely list visibility reduce missed or delayed responses.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an invitation and verifying notification content plus list visibility timing within one minute.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a new invitation is created, **When** the notification is generated, **Then** it includes the paper title, assignment notice, and a login prompt.\\n2. **Given** a new invitation is created, **When** the reviewer opens their invitations list within one minute, **Then** the invitation is visible in the list (regardless of notification delivery).\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Handle status changes and errors safely (Priority: P3)\\n\\nA reviewer sees accurate invitation status information. If the due date passes while they are viewing the list, the status updates on the next refresh or user action. If the list fails to load, the error message avoids system details and includes retry guidance.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Accurate statuses and safe error messaging maintain trust and prevent confusion.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating due-date passage and retrieval errors while viewing the list.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** an invitation due date passes while the list is open, **When** the reviewer refreshes or performs an action, **Then** the status updates to the correct state.\\n2. **Given** an invitation list retrieval error, **When** the reviewer opens the list, **Then** the error message avoids system details and includes retry guidance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- A reviewer has no invitations; the list shows a clear empty state.\\n- Notification delivery fails, but invitations still appear in the list.\\n- A reviewer has exactly 20 invitations; pagination is not required.\\n- A due date passes while the reviewer is idle on the list page and no refresh occurs.\\n- The list retrieval service is temporarily unavailable.\\n\\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\\n\\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-11\\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-11-AT\\n- **Notes**: Updates clarifying invitation display, notification content, list ordering/pagination, and error messaging within the existing review invitation use case.\\n\\n## Assumptions\\n\\n- The CMS datastore already supports invitation status values and response due dates.\\n\\n## Out of Scope\\n\\n- Processing logic for Accept/Reject actions; this feature covers invitation receipt and display only.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST display a reviewer’s invitation list when the reviewer is authenticated.\\n- **FR-002**: Invitation list items MUST display the paper title, current status, and response due date.\\n- **FR-003**: Invitation statuses MUST include at least: pending, accepted, rejected, and declined.\\n- **FR-004**: Status definitions MUST be: **rejected** = reviewer explicitly rejected; **declined** = system auto-declined after due date passes.\\n- **FR-005**: Invitations MUST be ordered by newest first in the list.\\n- **FR-006**: When a reviewer has more than 20 invitations, the list MUST provide pagination to access older invitations.\\n- **FR-007**: If a due date passes while the list is open, the invitation status MUST update on the next list refresh or user action.\\n- **FR-008**: Error messages for invitation list failures MUST avoid system details and MUST include retry guidance text.\\n- **FR-009**: Notification content for review invitations MUST include the paper title, a clear assignment notice, and a prompt to log in to respond.\\n- **FR-010**: New invitations MUST become visible in the invitation list within 1 minute of assignment (list visibility only, not notification delivery).\\n\\n### Non-Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **NFR-001**: The invitation list MUST load within 2 seconds under normal load conditions.\\n- **NFR-002**: The invitation list and its actions MUST be fully keyboard accessible.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Review Invitation**: Represents a reviewer assignment request; includes paper title, status, response due date, assignment timestamp.\\n- **Notification**: Message that informs a reviewer of an assignment; includes paper title, assignment notice, and login prompt.\\n- **Reviewer**: Authenticated user who receives and responds to invitations.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: 100% of invitation list items display paper title, status, and response due date in acceptance testing.\\n- **SC-002**: New invitations are visible in the reviewer’s list within 1 minute of assignment (list visibility, not notification delivery).\\n- **SC-003**: Invitation list loads in 2 seconds or less for at least 95% of measured requests under normal load.\\n- **SC-004**: All invitation list actions can be completed using keyboard-only navigation in acceptance testing.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/root/493-lab/Lab2\"}","call_id":"call_ZfOzdaD4To3vvBDNRF32QECa"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
