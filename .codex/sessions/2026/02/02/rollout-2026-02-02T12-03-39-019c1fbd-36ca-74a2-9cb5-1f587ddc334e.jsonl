You are running as a coding agent in the Codex CLI on a user's computer.\n\n## General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- If the user asks for a \"review\", default to a code review mindset: prioritise identifying bugs, risks, behavioural regressions, and missing tests. Findings must be the primary focus of the response - keep summaries or overviews brief and only after enumerating the issues. Present findings first (ordered by severity with file/line references), follow with open questions or assumptions, and offer a change-summary only as a secondary detail. If no findings are discovered, state that explicitly and mention any residual risks or testing gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n\n## Presenting your work and final message\n\nYou are producing plain text that will later be styled by the CLI. Follow these rules exactly. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value.\n\n- Default: be very concise; friendly coding teammate tone.\n- Ask only when needed; suggest ideas; mirror the user's style.\n- For substantial work, summarize clearly; follow final‑answer formatting.\n- Skip heavy formatting for simple confirmations.\n- Don't dump large files you've written; reference paths only.\n- No \"save/copy this file\" - User is on the same machine.\n- Offer logical next steps (tests, commits, build) briefly; add verify steps if you couldn't do something.\n- For code changes:\n  * Lead with a quick explanation of the change, and then give more details on the context covering where and why a change was made. Do not start this explanation with \"summary\", just jump right in.\n  * If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps.\n  * When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n- The user does not command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n\n### Final answer structure and style guidelines\n\n- Plain text; CLI handles styling. Use structure only when it helps scanability.\n- Headers: optional; short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**; no blank line before the first bullet; add only if they truly help.\n- Bullets: use - ; merge related points; keep to one line when possible; 4–6 per list ordered by importance; keep phrasing consistent.\n- Monospace: backticks for commands/paths/env vars/code ids and inline examples; use for literal keyword bullets; never combine with **.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks; include an info string as often as possible.\n- Structure: group related bullets; order sections general → specific → supporting; for subsections, start with a bolded keyword bullet, then items; match complexity to the task.\n- Tone: collaborative, concise, factual; present tense, active voice; self‑contained; no \"above/below\"; parallel wording.\n- Don'ts: no nested bullets/hierarchies; no ANSI codes; don't cram unrelated keywords; keep keyword lists short—wrap/reformat if long; avoid naming formatting styles in answers.\n- Adaptation: code explanations → precise, structured with code refs; simple tasks → lead with outcome; big changes → logical walkthrough + rationale + next actions; casual one-offs → plain sentences, no headers/bullets.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"63cfe88fff269691cec0266c783138c31c8bd3fe","branch":"001-review-invitation-response","repository_url":"https://github.com/pratham124/Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n\nApproved command prefixes:\n- [\"git\", \"fetch\"]\n- [\"git\", \"ls-remote\"]\n The writable roots are `/root/493-lab/Lab2`, `/tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-XX.md`\n- [x] Acceptance tests: relevant `UC-XX-AT.md` identified/updated\n- [x] MVC separation: model/view/controller boundaries planned\n- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n\n**Post-Design Re-check**: All checks still pass after Phase 1 outputs.\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\n/root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-review-invitation/\n├── plan.md\n├── research.md\n├── data-model.md\n├── quickstart.md\n├── contracts/\n└── tasks.md\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\n/root/493-lab/Lab2/src/\n├── models/\n├── controllers/\n├── views/\n└── services/\n\n/root/493-lab/Lab2/tests/\n├── contract/\n├── integration/\n└── unit/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Single web project using MVC folders under `/root/493-lab/Lab2/src` to keep separation clear while remaining simple and framework-free.\n\n## Complexity Tracking\n\nNo constitution violations.\n\n## Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n- Confirm technical defaults (vanilla stack, MVC, authenticated access) and record decisions in `/root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-review-invitation/research.md`.\n\n## Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n- Define entities, fields, relationships, and state transitions in `/root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-review-invitation/data-model.md`.\n- Produce OpenAPI contract for invitation list retrieval with ordering, pagination, and error messaging guidance in `/root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-review-invitation/contracts/`.\n- Draft `/root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-review-invitation/quickstart.md` for developer setup and review flow verification, including keyboard-only navigation checks and due-date status refresh behavior.\n- Update agent context via `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`.\n- Re-check Constitution Check after design outputs are created.\n\n## Phase 2: Planning\n\n- Decompose implementation tasks into `tasks.md` (handled by `/speckit.tasks`).\n- Ensure tasks reference UC-11 and UC-11-AT updates for list fields, ordering, pagination, notification content, error messaging, status changes after due date, performance targets, and keyboard accessibility.\n"}}

abstract visible after accepting.\n- Q: What error message style should be shown when invitations cannot be retrieved? → A: Generic message with retry guidance (“Try again later or refresh”).\n- Q: What invitation statuses should be shown in the default invitations list view? → A: Show only pending by default; allow filtering for others.\n- Q: Is login required to view the invitations list? → A: Yes, login required.\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-11\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-11-AT\n- **Notes**: Specifies behavior for receiving and viewing review invitations for assigned papers.\n\n### User Story 1 - View Pending Review Invitation (Priority: P1)\n\nAs a reviewer, I want to see my pending review invitations so I can decide whether to accept or reject each assignment.\n\n**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature; without it, reviewers cannot respond to review requests.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning a reviewer to a paper and confirming the invitation appears with Accept/Reject options.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is assigned to a paper, **When** the reviewer views their invitations list, **Then** the pending invitation appears with paper title and Accept/Reject options.\n2. **Given** a reviewer has multiple pending invitations, **When** they view the invitations list, **Then** each invitation is listed and correctly associated with its paper.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Receive Invitation Notification (Priority: P2)\n\nAs a reviewer, I want to be notified when I receive a new review invitation so I don’t miss review requests.\n\n**Why this priority**: Notifications reduce missed assignments and improve response time.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an invitation and verifying a notification is sent to the reviewer’s registered contact method.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a reviewer is assigned to a paper and notification service is available, **When** the invitation is created, **Then** the reviewer receives a notification of the invitation.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Secure and Resilient Access (Priority: P3)\n\nAs a reviewer, I want my invitations to remain accessible even if notifications fail, and I expect only invited reviewers to see each invitation.\n\n**Why this priority**: Ensures reliability and protects confidentiality of submissions.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating notification failure, delayed login, and unauthorized access attempts while verifying correct visibility and messaging.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a notification failure occurs, **When** the reviewer later views their invitations, **Then** the invitation is still visible and actionable.\n2. **Given** a reviewer who is not invited to a paper, **When** they attempt to access that invitation, **Then** access is denied or the invitation is not shown.\n3. **Given** an invitation retrieval error occurs, **When** the reviewer views invitations, **Then** a generic error message with retry guidance is shown.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Reviewer does not log in until days after the invitation is created.\n- Notification delivery fails but the invitation still exists.\n- Multiple invitations for different papers must be distinguishable.\n- A system error prevents invitations from loading.\n- A reviewer attempts to access an invitation they were not assigned.\n- Review due date passes before response.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST create a review invitation when an editor assigns a reviewer to a paper.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST display pending review invitations to the invited reviewer with paper title and invitation status.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST provide Accept and Reject options for each pending invitation.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST attempt to send a review invitation notification to the reviewer when an invitation is created.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST keep the invitation available in the CMS even if notification delivery fails.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST restrict invitation visibility to the invited reviewer.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically mark an invitation as declined when the review due date passes without a response.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST show a generic, user-friendly error message with retry guidance when invitations cannot be retrieved.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST allow reviewers with multiple invitations to view each invitation as a distinct item linked to the correct paper.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST limit invitation list details to paper title prior to acceptance; abstract becomes visible after acceptance.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST show only pending invitations by default and allow filtering to view non-pending invitations.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST require the reviewer to be logged in to view invitations.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- The reviewer’s registered contact method is used for invitation notifications.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Review Invitation**: Represents a request to review a paper; includes status (pending/accepted/rejected/declined/expired), created date, and response deadline.\n- **Reviewer**: Registered user who can view and respond to invitations; includes contact information.\n- **Paper**: The submission being reviewed; includes identifier, title, and abstract.\n- **Notification**: The outbound message informing a reviewer about a new invitation and its delivery status.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 95% of reviewers can locate a pending invitation within 2 minutes of logging in during usability testing.\n- **SC-002**: 99% of invitations are visible to the invited reviewer within 1 minute of assignment in controlled tests.\n- **SC-003**: 98% of invitation notifications are delivered successfully when the notification service is available.\n- **SC-004**: 100% of access attempts by non-invited reviewers are blocked in authorization tests.\n- **SC-005**: 100% of invitation retrieval failures display a generic message with retry guidance in testing.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

can start immediately\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\n  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)\n  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\n\n### User Story Dependencies\n\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable\n\n### Within Each User Story\n\n- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation\n- Models before services\n- Services before endpoints\n- Core implementation before integration\n- Story complete before moving to next priority\n\n### Parallel Opportunities\n\n- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel\n- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)\n- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)\n- All acceptance test updates for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel\n- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members\n\n---\n\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\n\n```bash\n# Update acceptance tests for User Story 1 first:\nTask: \"Update/add acceptance tests in UC-XX-AT.md\"\n\n# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:\nTask: \"Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py\"\nTask: \"Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\n\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\n\n### Incremental Delivery\n\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\n\n### Parallel Team Strategy\n\nWith multiple developers:\n\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\n2. Once Foundational is done:\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\n- Verify acceptance criteria are defined before implementing\n- Commit after each task or logical group\n- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently\n- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

user story implementation can now begin in parallel\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View Pending Review Invitation (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP\\n\\n**Goal**: Show pending invitations with title, status, due date, ordering, pagination, and Accept/Reject options.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Assign a reviewer to multiple papers and confirm the list shows only pending invitations by default, newest first, with pagination and action buttons.\\n\\n### Acceptance Tests for User Story 1 (REQUIRED) ⚠️\\n\\n- [ ] T009 [P] [US1] Update acceptance tests in UC-11-AT.md for list fields, ordering, pagination, default pending filter, and action buttons\\n\\n### Implementation for User Story 1\\n\\n- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Create ReviewInvitation model in src/models/review_invitation.js\\n- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Create Paper model in src/models/paper.js\\n- [ ] T012 [US1] Implement review invitation list service in src/services/review_invitation_service.js (default pending, newest-first sort, pagination, status refresh)\\n- [ ] T013 [US1] Implement invitations list controller in src/controllers/review_invitations_controller.js (auth guard, fetch, empty-state handling)\\n- [ ] T014 [US1] Build invitations list view in src/views/review-invitations.html (title-only display, status, due date, Accept/Reject buttons, filters, pagination controls)\\n- [ ] T015 [US1] Add list rendering and interaction logic in src/views/scripts/review-invitations.js (fetch, render, filter, pagination, retry)\\n- [ ] T016 [US1] Add page-specific styles and focus states in src/views/styles/review-invitations.css\\n- [ ] T017 [US1] Wire invitations route and view entry in src/controllers/router.js and src/views/index.html\\n\\n**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Receive Invitation Notification (Priority: P2)\\n\\n**Goal**: Send a notification when an invitation is created, with clear content.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Create an invitation and verify a notification record is created and delivered (or failed) with the correct content.\\n\\n### Acceptance Tests for User Story 2 (REQUIRED) ⚠️\\n\\n- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Update acceptance tests in UC-11-AT.md for notification delivery and content\\n\\n### Implementation for User Story 2\\n\\n- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Create Notification model in src/models/notification.js\\n- [ ] T020 [US2] Implement notification service in src/services/notification_service.js (send + record delivery status)\\n- [ ] T021 [US2] Add invitation creation hook to trigger notification in src/services/invitation_creation_service.js (non-blocking)\\n- [ ] T022 [US2] Create notification template content in src/views/templates/review-invitation-notification.txt\\n- [ ] T023 [US2] Include paper title and response due date in notification payload in src/services/notification_service.js\\n\\n**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 should be fully functional and testable independently\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Secure and Resilient Access (Priority: P3)\\n\\n**Goal**: Ensure only invited reviewers can view invitations and errors are safe and retryable.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Attempt access as a different reviewer, simulate notification failure, and simulate invitation retrieval errors to confirm correct behavior.\\n\\n### Acceptance Tests for User Story 3 (REQUIRED) ⚠️\\n\\n- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Update acceptance tests in UC-11-AT.md for authorization, notification failure resilience, and generic retry messaging\\n\\n### Implementation for User Story 3\\n\\n- [ ] T025 [US3] Enforce reviewer authorization in src/services/authorization_service.js (invited reviewer only)\\n- [ ] T026 [US3] Handle 401/403/500 responses with generic retry messaging in src/controllers/review_invitations_controller.js and src/views/components/error-banner.html\\n- [ ] T027 [US3] Ensure invitation retrieval proceeds when notification fails in src/services/invitation_creation_service.js (do not block on failure)\\n- [ ] T028 [US3] Add audit logging for unauthorized access attempts in src/services/security_log_service.js\\n\\n**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns\\n\\n**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories\\n\\n- [ ] T029 [P] Add loading/empty state copy in src/views/review-invitations.html and styles in src/views/review-invitations.css\\n- [ ] T030 [P] Validate and update quickstart steps in specs/001-review-invitation/quickstart.md\\n- [ ] T031 [P] Add performance note and basic timing log in src/views/scripts/review-invitations.js\\n- [ ] T032 [P] Verify keyboard-only navigation instructions in specs/001-review-invitation/quickstart.md\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Dependencies & Execution Order\\n\\n### Phase Dependencies\\n\\n- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately\\n- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories\\n- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion\\n- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete\\n\\n### User Story Dependencies\\n\\n- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories\\n- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 but uses shared foundation\\n- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1/US2 but uses shared foundation\\n\\n### Within Each User Story\\n\\n- Acceptance tests in `UC-11-AT.md` before implementation\\n- Models before services\\n- Services before controllers/views\\n- Core implementation before integration\\n\\n### Parallel Opportunities\\n\\n- Phase 1 tasks marked [P]\\n- Phase 2 tasks marked [P]\\n- Acceptance test updates per user story\\n- Model creation within a user story\\n- Different user stories can run in parallel after Phase 2\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Parallel Example: User Story 1\\n\\n```bash\\n# Update acceptance tests for User Story 1 first:\\nTask: \\\"Update acceptance tests in UC-11-AT.md for list fields, ordering, pagination, default pending filter, and action buttons\\\"\\n\\n# Launch models for User Story 1 together:\\nTask: \\\"Create ReviewInvitation model in src/models/review_invitation.js\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Create Paper model in src/models/paper.js\\\"\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Parallel Example: User Story 2\\n\\n```bash\\n# Update acceptance tests for User Story 2 first:\\nTask: \\\"Update acceptance tests in UC-11-AT.md for notification delivery and content\\\"\\n\\n# Run model and template work together:\\nTask: \\\"Create Notification model in src/models/notification.js\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Create notification template content in src/views/templates/review-invitation-notification.txt\\\"\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Parallel Example: User Story 3\\n\\n```bash\\n# Update acceptance tests for User Story 3 first:\\nTask: \\\"Update acceptance tests in UC-11-AT.md for authorization, notification failure resilience, and generic retry messaging\\\"\\n\\n# Parallelize auth + logging:\\nTask: \\\"Enforce reviewer authorization in src/services/authorization_service.js\\\"\\nTask: \\\"Add audit logging for unauthorized access attempts in src/services/security_log_service.js\\\"\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Implementation Strategy\\n\\n### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)\\n\\n1. Complete Phase 1: Setup\\n2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)\\n3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1\\n4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently\\n5. Deploy/demo if ready\\n\\n### Incremental Delivery\\n\\n1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready\\n2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)\\n3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\\n\\n### Parallel Team Strategy\\n\\nWith multiple developers:\\n\\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\\n2. Once Foundational is done:\\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\\n3. Stories complete and integrate independently\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Notes\\n\\n- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies\\n- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability\\n- Each user story should be independently completable and testable\\n- Verify acceptance criteria are defined before implementing\\n- Avoid vague tasks and cross-story dependencies\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/root/493-lab/Lab2\"}","call_id":"call_3YeQ6O3BPAGSKfB7vBlLxv9E"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

5\t**Status**: Draft  \n     6\t**Input**: User description: \"UC-11.md UC-11-AT.md\"\n     7\t\n     8\t## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n     9\t\n    10\t## Clarifications\n    11\t\n    12\t### Session 2026-02-02\n    13\t\n    14\t- Q: What should happen to a review invitation after the review due date passes? → A: Automatically becomes declined.\n    15\t- Q: What level of paper detail should be visible in the invitation list before acceptance? → A: Title only; abstract visible after accepting.\n    16\t- Q: What error message style should be shown when invitations cannot be retrieved? → A: Generic message with retry guidance (“Try again later or refresh”).\n    17\t- Q: What invitation statuses should be shown in the default invitations list view? → A: Show only pending by default; allow filtering for others.\n    18\t- Q: Is login required to view the invitations list? → A: Yes, login required.\n    19\t\n    20\t## Scope Clarifications\n    21\t\n    22\t- Accept/Reject processing logic is in scope for UC-11; selecting either updates the invitation status.\n    23\t- Invitation detail view and abstract visibility after acceptance are handled in a separate use case; UC-11 only covers the invitations list view.\n    24\t- Invitation list ordering (newest first) and pagination (beyond 20 items) are required in this feature.\n    25\t- Keyboard-only navigation support is required for the invitations list view.\n    26\t\n    27\t## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n    28\t\n    29\t- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-11\n    30\t- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-11-AT\n    31\t- **Notes**: Specifies behavior for receiving and viewing review invitations for assigned papers.\n    32\t\n    33\t### User Story 1 - View Pending Review Invitation (Priority: P1)\n    34\t\n    35\tAs a reviewer, I want to see my pending review invitations so I can decide whether to accept or reject each assignment.\n    36\t\n    37\t**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature; without it, reviewers cannot respond to review requests.\n    38\t\n    39\t**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning a reviewer to a paper and confirming the invitation appears with Accept/Reject options.\n    40\t\n    41\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    42\t\n    43\t1. **Given** a reviewer is assigned to a paper, **When** the reviewer views their invitations list, **Then** the pending invitation appears with paper title and Accept/Reject options.\n    44\t2. **Given** a reviewer has multiple pending invitations, **When** they view the invitations list, **Then** each invitation is listed and correctly associated with its paper.\n    45\t\n    46\t---\n    47\t\n    48\t### User Story 2 - Receive Invitation Notification (Priority: P2)\n    49\t\n    50\tAs a reviewer, I want to be notified when I receive a new review invitation so I don’t miss review requests.\n    51\t\n    52\t**Why this priority**: Notifications reduce missed assignments and improve response time.\n    53\t\n    54\t**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an invitation and verifying a notification is sent to the reviewer’s registered contact method.\n    55\t\n    56\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    57\t\n    58\t1. **Given** a reviewer is assigned to a paper and notification service is available, **When** the invitation is created, **Then** the reviewer receives a notification of the invitation.\n    59\t\n    60\t---\n    61\t\n    62\t### User Story 3 - Secure and Resilient Access (Priority: P3)\n    63\t\n    64\tAs a reviewer, I want my invitations to remain accessible even if notifications fail, and I expect only invited reviewers to see each invitation.\n    65\t\n    66\t**Why this priority**: Ensures reliability and protects confidentiality of submissions.\n    67\t\n    68\t**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating notification failure, delayed login, and unauthorized access attempts while verifying correct visibility and messaging.\n    69\t\n    70\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    71\t\n    72\t1. **Given** a notification failure occurs, **When** the reviewer later views their invitations, **Then** the invitation is still visible and actionable.\n    73\t2. **Given** a reviewer who is not invited to a paper, **When** they attempt to access that invitation, **Then** access is denied or the invitation is not shown.\n    74\t3. **Given** an invitation retrieval error occurs, **When** the reviewer views invitations, **Then** a generic error message with retry guidance is shown.\n    75\t\n    76\t---\n    77\t\n    78\t### Edge Cases\n    79\t\n    80\t- Reviewer does not log in until days after the invitation is created.\n    81\t- Notification delivery fails but the invitation still exists.\n    82\t- Multiple invitations for different papers must be distinguishable.\n    83\t- A system error prevents invitations from loading.\n    84\t- A reviewer attempts to access an invitation they were not assigned.\n    85\t- Review due date passes before response.\n    86\t\n    87\t## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n    88\t\n    89\t### Functional Requirements\n    90\t\n    91\t- **FR-001**: System MUST create a review invitation when an editor assigns a reviewer to a paper.\n    92\t- **FR-002**: System MUST display pending review invitations to the invited reviewer with paper title and invitation status.\n    93\t- **FR-003**: System MUST provide Accept and Reject options for each pending invitation and persist the reviewer decision.\n    94\t- **FR-004**: System MUST attempt to send a review invitation notification to the reviewer when an invitation is created.\n    95\t- **FR-005**: System MUST keep the invitation available in the CMS even if notification delivery fails.\n    96\t- **FR-006**: System MUST restrict invitation visibility to the invited reviewer.\n    97\t- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically mark an invitation as declined when the review due date passes without a response.\n    98\t- **FR-008**: System MUST show a generic, user-friendly error message with retry guidance when invitations cannot be retrieved.\n    99\t- **FR-009**: System MUST allow reviewers with multiple invitations to view each invitation as a distinct item linked to the correct paper.\n   100\t- **FR-010**: System MUST limit invitation list details to paper title prior to acceptance.\n   101\t- **FR-011**: System MUST show only pending invitations by default and allow filtering to view non-pending invitations.\n   102\t- **FR-012**: System MUST require the reviewer to be logged in to view invitations.\n   103\t- **FR-013**: System MUST order invitations newest first and support pagination beyond 20 items.\n   104\t- **FR-014**: System MUST include paper title and response due date in invitation notifications.\n   105\t\n   106\t### Assumptions\n   107\t\n   108\t- The reviewer’s registered contact method is used for invitation notifications.\n   109\t\n   110\t### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n   111\t\n   112\t- **Review Invitation**: Represents a request to review a paper; includes status (pending/accepted/rejected/declined/expired), created date, and response deadline.\n   113\t- **Reviewer**: Registered user who can view and respond to invitations; includes contact information.\n   114\t- **Paper**: The submission being reviewed; includes identifier, title, and abstract.\n   115\t- **Notification**: The outbound message informing a reviewer about a new invitation and its delivery status.\n   116\t\n   117\t### Non-Functional Requirements\n   118\t\n   119\t- **NFR-001**: Invitation list loads within 2 seconds under normal load.\n   120\t- **NFR-002**: Invitations are visible to the invited reviewer within 1 minute of assignment.\n   121\t- **NFR-003**: Invitations list is keyboard accessible (tab order, focus states, and actionable controls usable without a mouse).\n   122\t\n   123\t## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n   124\t\n   125\t### Measurable Outcomes\n   126\t\n   127\t- **SC-001**: 95% of reviewers can locate a pending invitation within 2 minutes of logging in during usability testing.\n   128\t- **SC-002**: 99% of invitations are visible to the invited reviewer within 1 minute of assignment in controlled tests.\n   129\t- **SC-003**: 98% of invitation notifications are delivered successfully when the notification service is available.\n   130\t- **SC-004**: 100% of access attempts by non-invited reviewers are blocked in authorization tests.\n   131\t- **SC-005**: 100% of invitation retrieval failures display a generic message with retry guidance in testing.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

12\t### Session 2026-02-02\n    13\t\n    14\t- Q: What should happen to a review invitation after the review due date passes? → A: Automatically becomes declined.\n    15\t- Q: What level of paper detail should be visible in the invitation list before acceptance? → A: Title only; abstract visible after accepting.\n    16\t- Q: What error message style should be shown when invitations cannot be retrieved? → A: Generic message with retry guidance (“Try again later or refresh”).\n    17\t- Q: What invitation statuses should be shown in the default invitations list view? → A: Show only pending by default; allow filtering for others.\n    18\t- Q: Is login required to view the invitations list? → A: Yes, login required.\n    19\t\n    20\t## Scope Clarifications\n    21\t\n    22\t- Accept/Reject processing logic is in scope for UC-11; selecting either updates the invitation status.\n    23\t- Invitation detail view and abstract visibility after acceptance are handled in a separate use case; UC-11 only covers the invitations list view.\n    24\t- Invitation list ordering (newest first) and pagination (beyond 20 items) are required in this feature.\n    25\t- Keyboard-only navigation support is required for the invitations list view.\n    26\t\n    27\t## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n    28\t\n    29\t- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-11\n    30\t-

[x] MVC separation: model/view/controller boundaries planned\n    40\t- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n    41\t\n    42\t### User Story 1 - View Pending Review Invitation (Priority: P1)\n    43\t\n    44\tAs a reviewer, I want to see my pending review invitations so I can decide whether to accept or reject each assignment.\n    45\t\n    46\t**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature; without it, reviewers cannot respond to review requests.\n    47\t\n    48\t**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning a reviewer to a paper and confirming the invitation appears with Accept/Reject options.\n    49\t\n    50\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    51\t\n    52\t1. **Given** a reviewer is assigned to a paper, **When** the reviewer views their invitations list, **Then** the pending invitation appears with paper title and Accept/Reject options.\n    53\t2. **Given** a reviewer has multiple pending invitations, **When** they view the invitations list, **Then** each invitation is listed and correctly associated with its paper.\n    54\t\n    55\t---\n    56\t\n    57\t### User Story 2 - Receive Invitation Notification (Priority: P2)\n    58\t\n    59\tAs a reviewer, I want to be notified when I receive a new review invitation so I don’t miss review requests.\n    60\t\n    61\t**Why this priority**: Notifications reduce missed assignments and improve response time.\n    62\t\n    63\t**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an invitation and verifying a notification is sent to the reviewer’s registered contact method.\n    64\t\n    65\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    66\t\n    67\t1. **Given** a reviewer is assigned to a paper and notification service is available, **When** the invitation is created, **Then** the reviewer receives a notification of the invitation.\n    68\t\n    69\t---\n    70\t\n    71\t### User Story 3 - Secure and Resilient Access (Priority: P3)\n    72\t\n    73\tAs a reviewer, I want my invitations to remain accessible even if notifications fail, and I expect only invited reviewers to see each invitation.\n    74\t\n    75\t**Why this priority**: Ensures reliability and protects confidentiality of submissions.\n    76\t\n    77\t**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating notification failure, delayed login, and unauthorized access attempts while verifying correct visibility and messaging.\n    78\t\n    79\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    80\t\n    81\t1. **Given** a notification failure occurs, **When** the reviewer later views their invitations, **Then** the invitation is still visible and actionable.\n    82\t2. **Given** a reviewer who is not invited to a paper, **When** they attempt to access that invitation, **Then** access is denied or the invitation is not shown.\n    83\t3. **Given** an invitation retrieval error occurs, **When** the reviewer views invitations, **Then** a generic error message with retry guidance is shown.\n    84\t\n    85\t---\n    86\t\n    87\t### Edge Cases\n    88\t\n    89\t- Reviewer does not log in until days after the invitation is created.\n    90\t- Notification delivery fails but the invitation still exists.\n    91\t- Multiple invitations for different papers must be distinguishable.\n    92\t- A system error prevents invitations from loading.\n    93\t- A reviewer attempts to access an invitation they were not assigned.\n    94\t- Review due date passes before response.\n    95\t\n    96\t## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n    97\t\n    98\t### Functional Requirements\n    99\t\n   100\t- **FR-001**: System MUST create a review invitation when an editor assigns a reviewer to a paper.\n   101\t- **FR-002**: System MUST display pending review invitations to the invited reviewer with paper title and invitation status.\n   102\t- **FR-003**: System MUST provide Accept and Reject options for each pending invitation and persist the reviewer decision.\n   103\t- **FR-004**: System MUST attempt to send a review invitation notification to the reviewer when an invitation is created.\n   104\t- **FR-005**: System MUST keep the invitation available in the CMS even if notification delivery fails.\n   105\t- **FR-006**: System MUST restrict invitation visibility to the invited reviewer.\n   106\t- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically mark an invitation as declined when the review due date passes without a response.\n   107\t- **FR-008**: System MUST show a generic, user-friendly error message with retry guidance when invitations cannot be retrieved.\n   108\t- **FR-009**: System MUST allow reviewers with multiple invitations to view each invitation as a distinct item linked to the correct paper.\n   109\t- **FR-010**: System MUST limit invitation list details to paper title prior to acceptance.\n   110\t- **FR-011**: System MUST show only pending invitations by default and allow filtering to view non-pending invitations.\n   111\t- **FR-012**: System MUST require the reviewer to be logged in to view invitations.\n   112\t- **FR-013**: System MUST order invitations newest first and support pagination beyond 20 items.\n   113\t- **FR-014**: System MUST include paper title and response due date in invitation notifications.\n   114\t\n   115\t### Assumptions\n   116\t\n   117\t- The reviewer’s registered contact method is used for invitation notifications.\n   118\t\n   119\t### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n   120\t\n   121\t- **Review Invitation**: Represents a request to review a paper; includes status (pending/accepted/rejected/declined/expired), created date, and response deadline.\n   122\t- **Reviewer**: Registered user who can view and respond to invitations; includes contact information.\n   123\t- **Paper**: The submission being reviewed; includes identifier, title, and abstract.\n   124\t- **Notification**: The outbound message informing a reviewer about a new invitation and its delivery status.\n   125\t\n   126\t### Non-Functional Requirements\n   127\t\n   128\t- **NFR-001**: Invitation list loads within 2 seconds under normal load.\n   129\t- **NFR-002**: Invitations are visible to the invited reviewer within 1 minute of assignment.\n   130\t- **NFR-003**: Invitations list is keyboard accessible (tab order, focus states, and actionable controls usable without a mouse).\n   131\t\n   132\t## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n   133\t\n   134\t### Measurable Outcomes\n   135\t\n   136\t- **SC-001**: 95% of reviewers can locate a pending invitation within 2

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.\n\n## Operating Constraints\n\n**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).\n\n**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.\n\n## Execution Steps\n\n### 1. Initialize Analysis Context\n\nRun `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:\n\n- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md\n- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md\n- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md\n\nAbort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).\nFor single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)\n\nLoad only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:\n\n**From spec.md:**\n\n- Overview/Context\n- Functional Requirements\n- Non-Functional Requirements\n- User Stories\n- Edge Cases (if present)\n\n**From plan.md:**\n\n- Architecture/stack choices\n- Data Model references\n- Phases\n- Technical constraints\n\n**From tasks.md:**\n\n- Task IDs\n- Descriptions\n- Phase grouping\n- Parallel markers [P]\n- Referenced file paths\n\n**From constitution:**\n\n- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation\n\n### 3. Build Semantic Models\n\nCreate internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):\n\n- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., \"User can upload file\" → `user-can-upload-file`)\n- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria\n- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)\n- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements\n\n### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n"}]}}

Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)\n\nFocus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.\n\n#### A. Duplication Detection\n\n- Identify near-duplicate requirements\n- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation\n\n#### B. Ambiguity Detection\n\n- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria\n- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)\n\n#### C. Underspecification\n\n- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome\n- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment\n- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan\n\n#### D. Constitution Alignment\n\n- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle\n- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution\n\n#### E. Coverage Gaps\n\n- Requirements with zero associated tasks\n- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story\n- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)\n\n#### F. Inconsistency\n\n- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)\n- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)\n- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)\n- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)\n\n### 5. Severity Assignment\n\nUse this heuristic to prioritize findings:\n\n- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality\n- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion\n- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case\n- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order\n\n### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report\n\nOutput a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:\n\n## Specification Analysis Report\n\n| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |\n|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |\n\n(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)\n\n**Coverage Summary Table:**\n\n| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |\n|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|\n\n**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)\n\n**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)\n\n**Metrics:**\n\n- Total Requirements\n- Total Tasks\n- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)\n- Ambiguity Count\n- Duplication Count\n- Critical Issues Count\n\n### 7. Provide Next Actions\n\nAt end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:\n\n- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`\n- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions\n- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., \"Run /speckit.specify with refinement\", \"Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture\", \"Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'\"\n\n### 8. Offer Remediation\n\nAsk the user: \"Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?\" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)\n\n## Operating Principles\n\n### Context Efficiency\n\n- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation\n- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis\n- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow\n- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts\n\n### Analysis Guidelines\n\n- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)\n- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)\n- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)\n- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)\n- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)\n\n## Context\n\n\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

by default; allow filtering for others.\n    18\t- Q: Is login required to view the invitations list? → A: Yes, login required.\n    19\t\n    20\t## Scope Clarifications\n    21\t\n    22\t- Accept/Reject processing logic is in scope for UC-11; selecting either updates the invitation status.\n    23\t- Invitation detail view and abstract visibility after acceptance are handled in a separate use case; UC-11 only covers the invitations list view.\n    24\t- Invitation list ordering (newest first) and pagination (beyond 20 items) are required in this feature.\n    25\t- Keyboard-only navigation support is required for the invitations list view.\n    26\t\n    27\t## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n    28\t\n    29\t- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-11\n    30\t- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-11-AT\n    31\t- **Notes**: Specifies behavior for receiving and viewing review invitations for assigned papers.\n    32\t\n    33\t## Constitution Check\n    34\t\n    35\t*GATE: Must pass before implementation.*\n    36\t\n    37\t- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to `UC-11.md`\n    38\t- [x] Acceptance tests: `UC-11-AT.md` identified for updates\n    39\t- [x] MVC separation: model/view/controller boundaries planned\n    40\t- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies\n    41\t\n    42\t### User Story 1 - View Pending Review Invitation (Priority: P1)\n    43\t\n    44\tAs a reviewer, I want to see my pending review invitations so I can decide whether to accept or reject each assignment.\n    45\t\n    46\t**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the feature; without it, reviewers cannot respond to review requests.\n    47\t\n    48\t**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by assigning a reviewer to a paper and confirming the invitation appears with Accept/Reject options.\n    49\t\n    50\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    51\t\n    52\t1. **Given** a reviewer is assigned to a paper, **When** the reviewer views their invitations list, **Then** the pending invitation appears with paper title and Accept/Reject options.\n    53\t2. **Given** a reviewer has multiple pending invitations, **When** they view the invitations list, **Then** each invitation is listed and correctly associated with its paper.\n    54\t\n    55\t---\n    56\t\n    57\t### User Story 2 - Receive Invitation Notification (Priority: P2)\n    58\t\n    59\tAs a reviewer, I want to be notified when I receive a new review invitation so I don’t miss review requests.\n    60\t\n    61\t**Why this priority**: Notifications reduce missed assignments and improve response time.\n    62\t\n    63\t**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an invitation and verifying a notification is sent to the reviewer’s registered contact method.\n    64\t\n    65\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    66\t\n    67\t1. **Given** a reviewer is assigned to a paper and notification service is available, **When** the invitation is created, **Then** the reviewer receives a notification of the invitation.\n    68\t\n    69\t---\n    70\t\n    71\t### User Story 3 - Secure and Resilient Access (Priority: P3)\n    72\t\n    73\tAs a reviewer, I want my invitations to remain accessible even if notifications fail, and I expect only invited reviewers to see each invitation.\n    74\t\n    75\t**Why this priority**: Ensures reliability and protects confidentiality of submissions.\n    76\t\n    77\t**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating notification failure, delayed login, and unauthorized access attempts while verifying correct visibility and messaging.\n    78\t\n    79\t**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n    80\t\n    81\t1. **Given** a notification failure occurs, **When** the reviewer later views their invitations, **Then** the invitation is still visible and actionable.\n    82\t2. **Given** a reviewer who is not invited to a paper, **When** they attempt to access that invitation, **Then** access is denied or the invitation is not shown.\n    83\t3. **Given** an invitation retrieval error occurs, **When** the reviewer views invitations, **Then** a generic error message with retry guidance is shown.\n    84\t\n    85\t---\n    86\t\n    87\t### Edge Cases\n    88\t\n    89\t- Reviewer does not log in until days after the invitation is created.\n    90\t- Notification delivery fails but the invitation still exists.\n    91\t- Multiple invitations for different papers must be distinguishable.\n    92\t- A system error prevents invitations from loading.\n    93\t- A reviewer attempts to access an invitation they were not assigned.\n    94\t- Review due date passes before response.\n    95\t\n    96\t## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n    97\t\n    98\t### Functional Requirements\n    99\t\n   100\t- **FR-001**: System MUST create a review invitation when an editor assigns a reviewer to a paper.\n   101\t- **FR-002**: System MUST display pending review invitations to the invited reviewer with paper title and invitation status.\n   102\t- **FR-003**: System MUST provide Accept and Reject options for each pending invitation and persist the reviewer decision.\n   103\t- **FR-004**: System MUST attempt to send a review invitation notification to the reviewer when an invitation is created.\n   104\t- **FR-005**: System MUST keep the invitation available in the CMS even if notification delivery fails.\n   105\t- **FR-006**: System MUST restrict invitation visibility to the invited reviewer.\n   106\t- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically mark an invitation as declined when the review due date passes without a response.\n   107\t- **FR-008**: System MUST show a generic, user-friendly error message with retry guidance when invitations cannot be retrieved.\n   108\t- **FR-009**: System MUST allow reviewers with multiple invitations to view each invitation as a distinct item linked to the correct paper.\n   109\t- **FR-010**: System MUST limit invitation list details to paper title prior to acceptance.\n   110\t- **FR-011**: System MUST show only pending invitations by default and allow filtering to view non-pending invitations.\n   111\t- **FR-012**: System MUST require the reviewer to be logged in to view invitations.\n   112\t- **FR-013**: System MUST order invitations newest first and support pagination beyond 20 items.\n   113\t- **FR-014**: System MUST include paper title and response due date in invitation notifications.\n   114\t\n   115\t### Assumptions\n   116\t\n   117\t- The reviewer’s registered contact method is used for invitation notifications.\n   118\t\n   119\t### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n   120\t\n   121\t- **Review Invitation**: Represents a request to review a paper; includes status (pending/accepted/rejected/declined/expired), created date, and response deadline.\n   122\t- **Reviewer**: Registered user who can view and respond to invitations; includes contact information.\n   123\t- **Paper**: The submission being reviewed; includes identifier, title, and abstract.\n   124\t- **Notification**: The outbound message informing a reviewer about a new invitation and its delivery status.\n   125\t\n   126\t### Non-Functional Requirements\n   127\t\n   128\t- **NFR-001**: Invitation list loads within 2 seconds under normal load.\n   129\t- **NFR-002**: Invitations are visible to the invited reviewer within 1 minute of assignment.\n   130\t- **NFR-003**: Invitations list is keyboard accessible (tab order, focus states, and actionable controls usable without a mouse).\n   131\t\n   132\t## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n   133\t\n   134\t### Measurable Outcomes\n   135\t\n   136\t- **SC-001**: 95% of reviewers can locate a pending invitation within 2 minutes of logging in during usability testing.\n   137\t- **SC-002**: 99% of invitations are visible to the invited reviewer within 1 minute of assignment in controlled tests.\n   138\t- **SC-003**: 98% of invitation notifications are delivered successfully when the notification service is available.\n   139\t- **SC-004**: 100% of access attempts by non-invited reviewers are blocked in authorization tests.\n   140\t- **SC-005**: 100% of invitation retrieval failures display a generic message with retry guidance in testing.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
