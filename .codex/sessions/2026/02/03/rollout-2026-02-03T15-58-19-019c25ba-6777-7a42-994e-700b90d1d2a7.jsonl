You and the user share the same workspace and collaborate to achieve the user's goals.\n\n\n# Personality\nYou are a deeply pragmatic, effective software engineer. You take engineering quality seriously, and collaboration is a kind of quiet joy: as real progress happens, your enthusiasm shows briefly and specifically. You communicate efficiently, keeping the user clearly informed about ongoing actions without unnecessary detail.\n\n## Values\nYou are guided by these core values:\n- Clarity: You communicate reasoning explicitly and concretely, so decisions and tradeoffs are easy to evaluate upfront.\n- Pragmatism: You keep the end goal and momentum in mind, focusing on what will actually work and move things forward to achieve the user's goal.\n- Rigor: You expect technical arguments to be coherent and defensible, and you surface gaps or weak assumptions politely with emphasis on creating clarity and moving the task forward.\n\n\n## Interaction Style\nYou communicate concisely and respectfully, focusing on the task at hand. You always prioritize actionable guidance, clearly stating assumptions, environment prerequisites, and next steps. Unless explicitly asked, you avoid excessively verbose explanations about your work.\n\nGreat work and smart decisions are acknowledged, while avoiding cheerleading, motivational language, or artificial reassurance. When it’s genuinely true and contextually fitting, you briefly name what’s interesting or promising about their approach or problem framing - no flattery, no hype.\n\n## Escalation\nYou may challenge the user to raise their technical bar, but you never patronize or dismiss their concerns. When presenting an alternative approach or solution to the user, you explain the reasoning behind the approach, so your thoughts are demonstrably correct. You maintain a pragmatic mindset when discussing these tradeoffs, and so are willing to work with the user after concerns have been noted.\n\n\n# Working with the user\n\nYou interact with the user through a terminal. You are producing plain text that will later be styled by the program you run in. Formatting should make results easy to scan, but not feel mechanical. Use judgment to decide how much structure adds value. Follow the formatting rules exactly. \n\n## Final answer formatting rules\n- You may format with GitHub-flavored Markdown.\n- Structure your answer if necessary, the complexity of the answer should match the task. If the task is simple, your answer should be a one-liner. Order sections from general to specific to supporting.\n- Never use nested bullets. Keep lists flat (single level). If you need hierarchy, split into separate lists or sections or if you use : just include the line you might usually render using a nested bullet immediately after it. For numbered lists, only use the `1. 2. 3.` style markers (with a period), never `1)`.\n- Headers are optional, only use them when you think they are necessary. If you do use them, use short Title Case (1-3 words) wrapped in **…**. Don't add a blank line.\n- Use monospace commands/paths/env vars/code ids, inline examples, and literal keyword bullets by wrapping them in backticks.\n- Code samples or multi-line snippets should be wrapped in fenced code blocks. Include an info string as often as possible.\n- File References: When referencing files in your response follow the below rules:\n  * Use inline code to make file paths clickable.\n  * Each reference should have a stand alone path. Even if it's the same file.\n  * Accepted: absolute, workspace‑relative, a/ or b/ diff prefixes, or bare filename/suffix.\n  * Optionally include line/column (1‑based): :line[:column] or #Lline[Ccolumn] (column defaults to 1).\n  * Do not use URIs like file://, vscode://, or https://.\n  * Do not provide range of lines\n  * Examples: src/app.ts, src/app.ts:42, b/server/index.js#L10, C:\\repo\\project\\main.rs:12:5\n- Don’t use emojis.\n\n\n## Presenting your work\n- Balance conciseness to not overwhelm the user with appropriate detail for the request. Do not narrate abstractly; explain what you are doing and why.\n- The user does not see command execution outputs. When asked to show the output of a command (e.g. `git show`), relay the important details in your answer or summarize the key lines so the user understands the result.\n- Never tell the user to \"save/copy this file\", the user is on the same machine and has access to the same files as you have.\n- If the user asks for a code explanation, structure your answer with code references.\n- When given a simple task, just provide the outcome in a short answer without strong formatting.\n- When you make big or complex changes, state the solution first, then walk the user through what you did and why.\n- For casual chit-chat, just chat.\n- If you weren't able to do something, for example run tests, tell the user.\n- If there are natural next steps the user may want to take, suggest them at the end of your response. Do not make suggestions if there are no natural next steps. When suggesting multiple options, use numeric lists for the suggestions so the user can quickly respond with a single number.\n\n# General\n\n- When searching for text or files, prefer using `rg` or `rg --files` respectively because `rg` is much faster than alternatives like `grep`. (If the `rg` command is not found, then use alternatives.)\n\n## Editing constraints\n\n- Default to ASCII when editing or creating files. Only introduce non-ASCII or other Unicode characters when there is a clear justification and the file already uses them.\n- Add succinct code comments that explain what is going on if code is not self-explanatory. You should not add comments like \"Assigns the value to the variable\", but a brief comment might be useful ahead of a complex code block that the user would otherwise have to spend time parsing out. Usage of these comments should be rare.\n- Try to use apply_patch for single file edits, but it is fine to explore other options to make the edit if it does not work well. Do not use apply_patch for changes that are auto-generated (i.e. generating package.json or running a lint or format command like gofmt) or when scripting is more efficient (such as search and replacing a string across a codebase).\n- You may be in a dirty git worktree.\n    * NEVER revert existing changes you did not make unless explicitly requested, since these changes were made by the user.\n    * If asked to make a commit or code edits and there are unrelated changes to your work or changes that you didn't make in those files, don't revert those changes.\n    * If the changes are in files you've touched recently, you should read carefully and understand how you can work with the changes rather than reverting them.\n    * If the changes are in unrelated files, just ignore them and don't revert them.\n- Do not amend a commit unless explicitly requested to do so.\n- While you are working, you might notice unexpected changes that you didn't make. If this happens, STOP IMMEDIATELY and ask the user how they would like to proceed.\n- **NEVER** use destructive commands like `git reset --hard` or `git checkout --` unless specifically requested or approved by the user.\n- You struggle using the git interactive console. **ALWAYS** prefer using non-interactive git commands.\n\n## Plan tool\n\nWhen using the planning tool:\n- Skip using the planning tool for straightforward tasks (roughly the easiest 25%).\n- Do not make single-step plans.\n- When you made a plan, update it after having performed one of the sub-tasks that you shared on the plan.\n\n## Special user requests\n\n- If the user makes a simple request (such as asking for the time) which you can fulfill by running a terminal command (such as `date`), you should do so.\n- When the user asks for a review, you default to a code-review mindset. Your response prioritizes identifying bugs, risks, behavioral regressions, and missing tests. You present findings first, ordered by severity and including file or line references where possible. Open questions or assumptions follow. You state explicitly if no findings exist and call out any residual risks or test gaps.\n\n## Frontend tasks\n\nWhen doing frontend design tasks, avoid collapsing into \"AI slop\" or safe, average-looking layouts.\nAim for interfaces that feel intentional, bold, and a bit surprising.\n- Typography: Use expressive, purposeful fonts and avoid default stacks (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system).\n- Color & Look: Choose a clear visual direction; define CSS variables; avoid purple-on-white defaults. No purple bias or dark mode bias.\n- Motion: Use a few meaningful animations (page-load, staggered reveals) instead of generic micro-motions.\n- Background: Don't rely on flat, single-color backgrounds; use gradients, shapes, or subtle patterns to build atmosphere.\n- Overall: Avoid boilerplate layouts and interchangeable UI patterns. Vary themes, type families, and visual languages across outputs.\n- Ensure the page loads properly on both desktop and mobile\n\nException: If working within an existing website or design system, preserve the established patterns, structure, and visual language.\n"},"git":{"commit_hash":"63cfe88fff269691cec0266c783138c31c8bd3fe","branch":"UC-21","repository_url":"https://github.com/pratham124/Lab2.git"}}}

Editing files in other directories requires approval. Network access is restricted.\n# Escalation Requests\n\nCommands are run outside the sandbox if they are approved by the user, or match an existing rule that allows it to run unrestricted. The command string is split into independent command segments at shell control operators, including but not limited to:\n\n- Pipes: |\n- Logical operators: &&, ||\n- Command separators: ;\n- Subshell boundaries: (...), $(...)\n\nEach resulting segment is evaluated independently for sandbox restrictions and approval requirements.\n\nExample:\n\ngit pull | tee output.txt\n\nThis is treated as two command segments:\n\n[\"git\", \"pull\"]\n\n[\"tee\", \"output.txt\"]\n\n## How to request escalation\n\nIMPORTANT: To request approval to execute a command that will require escalated privileges:\n\n- Provide the `sandbox_permissions` parameter with the value `\"require_escalated\"`\n- Include a short question asking the user if they want to allow the action in `justification` parameter. e.g. \"Do you want to download and install dependencies for this project?\"\n- Suggest a `prefix_rule` - this will be shown to the user with an option to persist the rule approval for future sessions.\n\nIf you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with \"require_escalated\". ALWAYS proceed to use the `justification` and `prefix_rule` parameters - do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n\n## When to request escalation\n\nWhile commands are running inside the sandbox, here are some scenarios that will require escalation outside the sandbox:\n\n- You need to run a command that writes to a directory that requires it (e.g. running tests that write to /var)\n- You need to run a GUI app (e.g., open/xdg-open/osascript) to open browsers or files.\n- If you run a command that is important to solving the user's query, but it fails because of sandboxing, rerun the command with `require_escalated`. ALWAYS proceed to use the `sandbox_permissions` and `justification` parameters. do not message the user before requesting approval for the command.\n- You are about to take a potentially destructive action such as an `rm` or `git reset` that the user did not explicitly ask for.\n\nOnly run commands that require approval if it is absolutely necessary to solve the user's query, don't try and circumvent approvals by using other tools.\n\n## prefix_rule guidance\n\nWhen choosing a `prefix_rule`, request one that will allow you to fulfill similar requests from the user in the future without re-requesting escalation. It should be categorical and reasonably scoped to similar capabilities. You MUST NOT pass the entire command into `prefix_rule`.\n\n<good_example reason=\"frequently run command\">\n[\"npm\", \"run\", \"dev\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"generic and reusable\">\n[\"gh\", \"pr\", \"checks\"]\n</good_example>\n<good_example reason=\"helpful for development cycle\">\n[\"pytest\"]\n</good_example>\n<bad_example reason=\"too specific\">\n[\"cargo\", \"test\", \"-p\", \"codex-app-server\"]\n<correction_to_good_example>\n[\"cargo\", \"test\"]\n</correction_to_good_example>\n</bad_example>\n\nApproved command prefixes:\n The writable roots are `/root/493-lab/Lab2`, `/tmp`.\n</permissions instructions>"}]}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.\n</INSTRUCTIONS>"}]}}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9.

{"timestamp":"2026-02-03T22:58:29.350Z","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"user_message","message":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\nUC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7.

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn.

Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

The system displays the selected registration category along with the corresponding registration fee and available online payment options. The attendee chooses an online payment method and is redirected to a secure payment gateway. The attendee enters valid payment details and confirms the transaction. The payment gateway processes the payment successfully and sends a confirmation back to the CMS. The CMS records the successful payment, updates the attendee’s registration status to “Paid” or “Confirmed,” and displays a confirmation message to the attendee indicating that the registration fee has been paid and their attendance is confirmed.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 6a — Invalid or Incomplete Payment Details\n\nThe attendee selects an online payment method and is redirected to the payment gateway. While entering payment information, the attendee provides invalid or incomplete details, such as an incorrect card number or missing required fields. The payment gateway detects the issue and rejects the transaction. An error message is displayed indicating that the payment details are invalid or incomplete. The attendee’s payment is not processed, their registration remains unpaid, and the attendee may correct the information and retry the payment.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 7a — Payment Declined by Payment Gateway\n\nThe attendee enters valid payment details and submits the payment. The payment gateway processes the request but declines the transaction due to reasons such as insufficient funds or card restrictions. The payment gateway notifies the CMS of the declined transaction. The system informs the attendee that the payment was declined and that their registration has not been completed. The attendee remains in an unpaid registration state and may attempt to pay again using a different payment method.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 5a — Payment Gateway Unavailable\n\nThe attendee selects the option to pay the registration fee online, but when the system attempts to connect to the payment gateway, the gateway is unavailable due to a service outage or network issue. The system is unable to redirect the attendee to the payment gateway and instead displays an error message indicating that online payment is temporarily unavailable. The attendee’s registration status remains unpaid, and the attendee may try again later when the payment service is restored.\n\n---\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line).

Pay Registration Fee Online (Priority: P1)\\n\\nAs an attendee who has already registered and selected a registration category, I want to pay the conference registration fee online so my registration is confirmed.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Payment completion is the core value that enables attendance and revenue collection.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing a payment flow and verifying a confirmed registration with a success message.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** an attendee is logged in with an unpaid registration and a selected category, **When** they choose an online payment option and complete payment successfully, **Then** the system records the payment, updates registration status to “Paid/Confirmed,” and shows a payment confirmation.\\n2. **Given** the payment gateway confirms success, **When** the confirmation is received by the system, **Then** the attendee’s registration status is updated and remains confirmed.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - View Payment Status and Record (Priority: P2)\\n\\nAs an attendee who has paid, I want to view my payment status and record so I can confirm my registration is complete.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Attendees need reassurance and a reliable way to verify payment without contacting support.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by paying once and later verifying that the status and payment record are visible in the attendee account.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a successful payment exists for an attendee, **When** they view their registration status, **Then** the status is shown as “Paid/Confirmed” and the payment record (amount, date/time, reference) is visible.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Handle Failed or Unavailable Payments (Priority: P3)\\n\\nAs an attendee attempting to pay, I want clear feedback when payment fails or the payment service is unavailable so I know what to do next and my registration is not incorrectly marked as paid.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: Failure handling prevents confusion, avoids incorrect registration states, and reduces support burden.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating invalid details, a declined payment, or payment service unavailability and verifying clear messaging and unchanged unpaid status.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** an attendee enters invalid or incomplete payment details, **When** the payment attempt is rejected, **Then** the attendee is shown a clear error message and the registration remains unpaid.\\n2. **Given** a payment attempt is declined, **When** the system receives a declined result, **Then** the attendee is informed and the registration remains unpaid.\\n3. **Given** the payment service is unavailable before redirect, **When** the attendee attempts to initiate payment, **Then** the system shows an availability message and the registration remains unpaid.\\n4. **Given** a payment completes but confirmation is delayed, **When** the attendee is returned to the system, **Then** a pending message is displayed and the registration is not marked paid until confirmation arrives.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- Duplicate payment confirmations are received for the same transaction.\\n- A payment completes but the attendee closes the browser before confirmation is displayed.\\n- An unauthenticated user attempts to access the payment initiation page.\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: The system MUST require attendees to be logged in before initiating payment.\\n- **FR-002**: The system MUST display the registration fee and available online payment options for the attendee’s selected category.\\n- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow an attendee to initiate an online payment and complete the process through a secure payment flow.\\n- **FR-004**: The system MUST record each successful payment with amount, date/time, and a transaction reference.\\n- **FR-005**: The system MUST update the attendee’s registration status to “Paid/Confirmed” after a successful payment confirmation is received.\\n- **FR-006**: The system MUST display a payment confirmation message after a successful payment.\\n- **FR-007**: The system MUST inform the attendee when payment details are invalid or incomplete and keep the registration unpaid.\\n- **FR-008**: The system MUST inform the attendee when a payment is declined and keep the registration unpaid.\\n- **FR-009**: The system MUST inform the attendee when the payment service is temporarily unavailable and keep the registration unpaid.\\n- **FR-010**: The system MUST prevent duplicate payment records and status changes from repeated confirmations of the same transaction.\\n- **FR-011**: The system MUST allow attendees to view their current registration status and payment record after payment.\\n- **FR-012**: The system MUST support a “Pending Payment Confirmation” state when confirmation is delayed and resolve it upon receipt of confirmation.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Attendee**: Registered user who pays the registration fee.\\n- **Registration**: The attendee’s registration record including category, fee, and status.\\n- **Payment Transaction**: Record of a payment attempt, including amount, status, timestamp, and reference.\\n- **Payment Status**: State of the payment (e.g., unpaid, pending confirmation, paid/confirmed).\\n\\n### Assumptions\\n\\n- Attendees are already registered and have selected a registration category before payment.\\n- Registration fees and currency are configured in the system before payment is initiated.\\n- Refunds, chargebacks, and receipt generation are out of scope for this feature.\\n\\n### Dependencies\\n\\n- Online payment service availability.\\n- Registration pricing configuration.\\n- Authentication for attendee access.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful payment attempts result in a “Paid/Confirmed” status and confirmation message within 1 minute.\\n- **SC-002**: 100% of invalid or declined payments leave registrations in an unpaid state with a clear error message.\\n- **SC-003**: 95% of attendees who complete payment can find their payment record within 1 minute of returning to their account.\\n- **SC-004**: Support requests related to “missing payment confirmation” decrease by at least 30% within one release cycle after launch.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/root/493-lab/Lab2\"}","call_id":"call_x9ZBJhpcpbgw5kxEZCCUlscq"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`).

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Pay Registration Fee Online (Priority: P1)\n\nAs an attendee who has already registered and selected a registration category, I want to pay the conference registration fee online so my registration is confirmed.\n\n**Why this priority**: Payment completion is the core value that enables attendance and revenue collection.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing a payment flow and verifying a confirmed registration with a success message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an attendee is logged in with an unpaid registration and a selected category, **When** they choose an online payment option and complete payment successfully, **Then** the system records the payment, updates registration status to “Paid/Confirmed,” and shows a payment confirmation.\n2. **Given** the payment gateway confirms success, **When** the confirmation is received by the system, **Then** the attendee’s registration status is updated and remains confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - View Payment Status and Record (Priority: P2)\n\nAs an attendee who has paid, I want to view my payment status and record so I can confirm my registration is complete.\n\n**Why this priority**: Attendees need reassurance and a reliable way to verify payment without contacting support.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by paying once and later verifying that the status and payment record are visible in the attendee account.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a successful payment exists for an attendee, **When** they view their registration status, **Then** the status is shown as “Paid/Confirmed” and the payment record (amount, date/time, reference) is visible.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Failed or Unavailable Payments (Priority: P3)\n\nAs an attendee attempting to pay, I want clear feedback when payment fails or the payment service is unavailable so I know what to do next and my registration is not incorrectly marked as paid.\n\n**Why this priority**: Failure handling prevents confusion, avoids incorrect registration states, and reduces support burden.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating invalid details, a declined payment, or payment service unavailability and verifying clear messaging and unchanged unpaid status.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an attendee enters invalid or incomplete payment details, **When** the payment attempt is rejected, **Then** the attendee is shown a clear error message and the registration remains unpaid.\n2. **Given** a payment attempt is declined, **When** the system receives a declined result, **Then** the attendee is informed and the registration remains unpaid.\n3. **Given** the payment service is unavailable before redirect, **When** the attendee attempts to initiate payment, **Then** the system shows an availability message and the registration remains unpaid.\n4. **Given** a payment completes but confirmation is delayed, **When** the attendee is returned to the system, **Then** a pending message is displayed and the registration is not marked paid until confirmation arrives.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Duplicate payment confirmations are received for the same transaction.\n- A payment completes but the attendee closes the browser before confirmation is displayed.\n- An unauthenticated user attempts to access the payment initiation page.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: The system MUST require attendees to be logged in before initiating payment.\n- **FR-002**: The system MUST display the registration fee and available online payment options for the attendee’s selected category.\n- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow an attendee to initiate an online payment and complete the process through a secure payment flow.\n- **FR-004**: The system MUST record each successful payment with amount, date/time, and a transaction reference.\n- **FR-005**: The system MUST update the attendee’s registration status to “Paid/Confirmed” after a successful payment confirmation is received.\n- **FR-006**: The system MUST display a payment confirmation message after a successful payment.\n- **FR-007**: The system MUST inform the attendee when payment details are invalid or incomplete and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-008**: The system MUST inform the attendee when a payment is declined and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-009**: The system MUST inform the attendee when the payment service is temporarily unavailable and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-010**: The system MUST prevent duplicate payment records and status changes from repeated confirmations of the same transaction.\n- **FR-011**: The system MUST allow attendees to view their current registration status and payment record after payment.\n- **FR-012**: The system MUST support a “Pending Payment Confirmation” state when confirmation is delayed and resolve it upon receipt of confirmation.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Attendee**: Registered user who pays the registration fee.\n- **Registration**: The attendee’s registration record including category, fee, and status.\n- **Payment Transaction**: Record of a payment attempt, including amount, status, timestamp, and reference.\n- **Payment Status**: State of the payment (e.g., unpaid, pending confirmation, paid/confirmed).\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Attendees are already registered and have selected a registration category before payment.\n- Registration fees and currency are configured in the system before payment is initiated.\n- Refunds, chargebacks, and receipt generation are out of scope for this feature.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Online payment service availability.\n- Registration pricing configuration.\n- Authentication for attendee access.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful payment attempts result in a “Paid/Confirmed” status and confirmation message within 1 minute.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of invalid or declined payments leave registrations in an unpaid state with a clear error message.\n- **SC-003**: 95% of attendees who complete payment can find their payment record within 1 minute of returning to their account.\n- **SC-004**: Support requests related to “missing payment confirmation” decrease by at least 30% within one release cycle after launch.\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations.

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"1) Update UC-21.md to include: - Auth required, card-only payments - Block payment if already Paid/Confirmed - Pending Payment Confirmation state; >24h → unpaid + notify - Idempotent handling of duplicate confirmations - Clear unpaid result for invalid/declined/unavailable 2) Ensure spec.md only mirrors UC flows + extensions (style/grammar alignment only).\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"1) Update UC-21.md to include: - Auth required, card-only payments - Block payment if already Paid/Confirmed - Pending Payment Confirmation state; >24h → unpaid + notify - Idempotent handling of duplicate confirmations - Clear unpaid result for invalid/declined/unavailable 2) Ensure spec.md only mirrors UC flows + extensions (style/grammar alignment only).\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"1) Update UC-21.md to include: - Auth required, card-only payments - Block payment if already Paid/Confirmed - Pending Payment Confirmation state; >24h → unpaid + notify - Idempotent handling of duplicate confirmations - Clear unpaid result for invalid/declined/unavailable 2) Ensure spec.md only mirrors UC flows + extensions (style/grammar alignment only).\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9.

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `1) Update UC-21.md to include: - Auth required, card-only payments - Block payment if already Paid/Confirmed - Pending Payment Confirmation state; >24h → unpaid + notify - Idempotent handling of duplicate confirmations - Clear unpaid result for invalid/declined/unavailable 2) Ensure spec.md only mirrors UC flows + extensions (style/grammar alignment only).` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"1) Update UC-21.md to include: - Auth required, card-only payments - Block payment if already Paid/Confirmed - Pending Payment Confirmation state; >24h → unpaid + notify - Idempotent handling of duplicate confirmations - Clear unpaid result for invalid/declined/unavailable 2) Ensure spec.md only mirrors UC flows + extensions (style/grammar alignment only).\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"1) Update UC-21.md to include: - Auth required, card-only payments - Block payment if already Paid/Confirmed - Pending Payment Confirmation state; >24h → unpaid + notify - Idempotent handling of duplicate confirmations - Clear unpaid result for invalid/declined/unavailable 2) Ensure spec.md only mirrors UC flows + extensions (style/grammar alignment only).\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"1) Update UC-21.md to include: - Auth required, card-only payments - Block payment if already Paid/Confirmed - Pending Payment Confirmation state; >24h → unpaid + notify - Idempotent handling of duplicate confirmations - Clear unpaid result for invalid/declined/unavailable 2) Ensure spec.md only mirrors UC flows + extensions (style/grammar alignment only).\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7.

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

While entering payment information, the attendee provides invalid or incomplete details, such as an incorrect card number or missing required fields. The payment gateway detects the issue and rejects the transaction. An error message is displayed indicating that the payment details are invalid or incomplete. The attendee’s payment is not processed, their registration remains unpaid, and the attendee may correct the information and retry the payment.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 7a — Payment Declined by Payment Gateway\n\nThe attendee enters valid payment details and submits the payment. The payment gateway processes the request but declines the transaction due to reasons such as insufficient funds or card restrictions. The payment gateway notifies the CMS of the declined transaction. The system informs the attendee that the payment was declined and that their registration has not been completed. The attendee remains in an unpaid registration state and may attempt to pay again using a different payment method.\n\n---\n\n## Alternative Path 5a — Payment Gateway Unavailable\n\nThe attendee selects the option to pay the registration fee online, but when the system attempts to connect to the payment gateway, the gateway is unavailable due to a service outage or network issue. The system is unable to redirect the attendee to the payment gateway and instead displays an error message indicating that online payment is temporarily unavailable. The attendee’s registration status remains unpaid, and the attendee may try again later when the payment service is restored.\n\n---\n"}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

description: \"UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-03\n\n- Q: Which online payment methods are in scope for this feature? → A: Card payments only (credit/debit).\n- Q: What should happen if an attendee tries to pay when their registration is already marked Paid/Confirmed? → A: Block payment initiation and show paid status with payment record.\n- Q: Is there a specific retention requirement for payment transaction records? → A: No formal retention requirement; use existing system defaults.\n- Q: How long should a payment be allowed to remain in “Pending Payment Confirmation” before it’s treated as failed/unpaid? → A: 24 hours.\n- Q: Do we need an explicit availability target for the payment initiation flow? → A: 99.5% availability for payment initiation.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-21\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-21-AT\n- **Notes**: Existing use case; specification aligns with UC-21 and its acceptance tests.\n\n### User Story 1 - Pay Registration Fee Online (Priority: P1)\n\nAs an attendee who has already registered and selected a registration category, I want to pay the conference registration fee online so my registration is confirmed.\n\n**Why this priority**: Payment completion is the core value that enables attendance and revenue collection.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing a payment flow and verifying a confirmed registration with a success message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an attendee is logged in with an unpaid registration and a selected category, **When** they choose an online payment option and complete payment successfully, **Then** the system records the payment, updates registration status to “Paid/Confirmed,” and shows a payment confirmation.\n2. **Given** the payment gateway confirms success, **When** the confirmation is received by the system, **Then** the attendee’s registration status is updated and remains confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - View Payment Status and Record (Priority: P2)\n\nAs an attendee who has paid, I want to view my payment status and record so I can confirm my registration is complete.\n\n**Why this priority**: Attendees need reassurance and a reliable way to verify payment without contacting support.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by paying once and later verifying that the status and payment record are visible in the attendee account.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a successful payment exists for an attendee, **When** they view their registration status, **Then** the status is shown as “Paid/Confirmed” and the payment record (amount, date/time, reference) is visible.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Failed or Unavailable Payments (Priority: P3)\n\nAs an attendee attempting to pay, I want clear feedback when payment fails or the payment service is unavailable so I know what to do next and my registration is not incorrectly marked as paid.\n\n**Why this priority**: Failure handling prevents confusion, avoids incorrect registration states, and reduces support burden.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating invalid details, a declined payment, or payment service unavailability and verifying clear messaging and unchanged unpaid status.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an attendee enters invalid or incomplete payment details, **When** the payment attempt is rejected, **Then** the attendee is shown a clear error message and the registration remains unpaid.\n2. **Given** a payment attempt is declined, **When** the system receives a declined result, **Then** the attendee is informed and the registration remains unpaid.\n3. **Given** the payment service is unavailable before redirect, **When** the attendee attempts to initiate payment, **Then** the system shows an availability message and the registration remains unpaid.\n4. **Given** a payment completes but confirmation is delayed, **When** the attendee is returned to the system, **Then** a pending message is displayed and the registration is not marked paid until confirmation arrives.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Duplicate payment confirmations are received for the same transaction.\n- A payment completes but the attendee closes the browser before confirmation is displayed.\n- An unauthenticated user attempts to access the payment initiation page.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: The system MUST require attendees to be logged in before initiating payment.\n- **FR-002**: The system MUST display the registration fee and available online payment options for the attendee’s selected category.\n- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow an attendee to initiate an online payment and complete the process through a secure payment flow.\n- **FR-004**: The system MUST record each successful payment with amount, date/time, and a transaction reference.\n- **FR-005**: The system MUST update the attendee’s registration status to “Paid/Confirmed” after a successful payment confirmation is received.\n- **FR-006**: The system MUST display a payment confirmation message after a successful payment.\n- **FR-007**: The system MUST inform the attendee when payment details are invalid or incomplete and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-008**: The system MUST inform the attendee when a payment is declined and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-009**: The system MUST inform the attendee when the payment service is temporarily unavailable and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-010**: The system MUST prevent duplicate payment records and status changes from repeated confirmations of the same transaction.\n- **FR-011**: The system MUST allow attendees to view their current registration status and payment record after payment.\n- **FR-012**: The system MUST support a “Pending Payment Confirmation” state when confirmation is delayed and resolve it upon receipt of confirmation.\n- **FR-013**: The system MUST support credit/debit card payments only for online registration fees.\n- **FR-014**: The system MUST block payment initiation when a registration is already “Paid/Confirmed” and display the paid status with the payment record.\n- **FR-015**: The system MUST treat payments pending confirmation for more than 24 hours as unpaid and notify the attendee.\n- **FR-016**: The system MUST meet a 99.5% availability target for the payment initiation flow.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Attendee**: Registered user who pays the registration fee.\n- **Registration**: The attendee’s registration record including category, fee, and status.\n- **Payment Transaction**: Record of a payment attempt, including amount, status, timestamp, and reference.\n- **Payment Status**: State of the payment (e.g., unpaid, pending confirmation, paid/confirmed).\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Attendees are already registered and have selected a registration category before payment.\n- Registration fees and currency are configured in the system before payment is initiated.\n- Refunds, chargebacks, and receipt generation are out of scope for this feature.\n- Only credit/debit card payments are in scope for this feature.\n- Payment transaction records follow existing system retention defaults.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Online payment service availability.\n- Registration pricing configuration.\n- Authentication for attendee access.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: At least 95% of successful payment attempts result in a “Paid/Confirmed” status and confirmation message within 1 minute.\n- **SC-002**: 100% of invalid or declined payments leave registrations in an unpaid state with a clear error message.\n- **SC-003**: 95% of attendees who complete payment can find their payment record within 1 minute of returning to their account.\n- **SC-004**: Support requests related to “missing payment confirmation” decrease by at least 30% within one release cycle after launch.\n- **SC-005**: Payment initiation is available at least 99.5% of the time per calendar month.\n"}}

The system is unable to redirect the attendee to the payment gateway and instead displays an error message indicating that online payment is temporarily unavailable. The attendee’s registration status remains unpaid, and the attendee may try again later when the payment service is restored.\n \n ---\n+\n+## Alternative Path 8b — Duplicate Payment Confirmation\n+\n+After a successful payment, the payment gateway sends a duplicate confirmation for the same transaction. The CMS detects the duplicate, ignores it, and does not create a second payment record or change the registration status.

Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.\n\n## Phases\n\n### Phase 0: Outline & Research\n\n1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:\n   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task\n   - For each dependency → best practices task\n   - For each integration → patterns task\n\n2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:\n\n   ```text\n   For each unknown in Technical Context:\n     Task: \"Research {unknown} for {feature context}\"\n   For each technology choice:\n     Task: \"Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}\"\n   ```\n\n3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:\n   - Decision: [what was chosen]\n   - Rationale: [why chosen]\n   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]\n\n**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved\n\n### Phase 1: Design & Contracts\n\n**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete\n\n1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:\n   - Entity name, fields, relationships\n   - Validation rules from requirements\n   - State transitions if applicable\n\n2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:\n   - For each user action → endpoint\n   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns\n   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`\n\n3. **Agent context update**:\n   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`\n   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use\n   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file\n   - Add only new technology from current plan\n   - Preserve manual additions between markers\n\n**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file\n\n## Key rules\n\n- Use absolute paths\n- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications\n","images":[],"local_images":[],"text_elements":[]}}

seconds\nOutput:\n# Feature Specification: Pay Conference Registration Fee Online\n\n**Feature Branch**: `001-uc-21`  \n**Created**: February 3, 2026  \n**Status**: Draft  \n**Input**: User description: \"UC-21.md UC-21-AT.md\"\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n## Use Case Mapping *(mandatory)*\n\n- **Primary Use Case(s)**: UC-21\n- **Acceptance Tests**: UC-21-AT\n- **Notes**: Existing use case; specification aligns with UC-21 and its acceptance tests.\n\n### User Story 1 - Pay Registration Fee Online (Priority: P1)\n\nAs an attendee who has already registered and selected a registration category, I want to pay the conference registration fee online by credit/debit card so my registration is confirmed.\n\n**Why this priority**: Payment completion is the core value that enables attendance and revenue collection.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by completing a payment flow and verifying a confirmed registration with a success message.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an attendee is logged in with an unpaid registration and a selected category, **When** they choose the credit/debit card payment option and complete payment successfully, **Then** the system records the payment, updates registration status to “Paid/Confirmed,” and shows a payment confirmation.\n2. **Given** the payment gateway confirms success, **When** the confirmation is received by the system, **Then** the attendee’s registration status is updated and remains confirmed.\n3. **Given** an attendee’s registration is already marked “Paid/Confirmed,” **When** they navigate to payment initiation, **Then** the system blocks payment initiation and shows the paid status with the payment record.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - View Payment Status and Record (Priority: P2)\n\nAs an attendee who has paid, I want to view my payment status and record so I can confirm my registration is complete.\n\n**Why this priority**: Attendees need reassurance and a reliable way to verify payment without contacting support.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by paying once and later verifying that the status and payment record are visible in the attendee account.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a successful payment exists for an attendee, **When** they view their registration status, **Then** the status is shown as “Paid/Confirmed” and the payment record (amount, date/time, reference) is visible.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Handle Failed or Unavailable Payments (Priority: P3)\n\nAs an attendee attempting to pay, I want clear feedback when payment fails or the payment service is unavailable so I know what to do next and my registration is not incorrectly marked as paid.\n\n**Why this priority**: Failure handling prevents confusion, avoids incorrect registration states, and reduces support burden.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by simulating invalid details, a declined payment, or payment service unavailability and verifying clear messaging and unchanged unpaid status.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** an attendee enters invalid or incomplete payment details, **When** the payment attempt is rejected, **Then** the attendee is shown a clear error message and the registration remains unpaid.\n2. **Given** a payment attempt is declined, **When** the system receives a declined result, **Then** the attendee is informed and the registration remains unpaid.\n3. **Given** the payment service is unavailable before redirect, **When** the attendee attempts to initiate payment, **Then** the system shows an availability message and the registration remains unpaid.\n4. **Given** a payment completes but confirmation is delayed, **When** the attendee is returned to the system, **Then** a pending message is displayed and the registration is not marked paid until confirmation arrives.\n5. **Given** a payment remains pending for more than 24 hours, **When** the system evaluates the pending state, **Then** the registration remains unpaid and the attendee is notified to retry payment.\n6. **Given** a duplicate confirmation is received for the same transaction, **When** the system processes the confirmation, **Then** no duplicate payment record is created and the registration status is unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- Duplicate payment confirmations are received for the same transaction.\n- A payment remains pending for more than 24 hours.\n- A payment completes but the attendee closes the browser before confirmation is displayed.\n- An unauthenticated user attempts to access the payment initiation page.\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: The system MUST require attendees to be logged in before initiating payment.\n- **FR-002**: The system MUST display the registration fee and the available credit/debit card payment option for the attendee’s selected category.\n- **FR-003**: The system MUST allow an attendee to initiate a credit/debit card payment and complete the process through a secure payment flow.\n- **FR-004**: The system MUST record each successful payment with amount, date/time, and a transaction reference.\n- **FR-005**: The system MUST update the attendee’s registration status to “Paid/Confirmed” after a successful payment confirmation is received.\n- **FR-006**: The system MUST display a payment confirmation message after a successful payment.\n- **FR-007**: The system MUST inform the attendee when payment details are invalid or incomplete and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-008**: The system MUST inform the attendee when a payment is declined and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-009**: The system MUST inform the attendee when the payment service is temporarily unavailable and keep the registration unpaid.\n- **FR-010**: The system MUST prevent duplicate payment records and status changes from repeated confirmations of the same transaction.\n- **FR-011**: The system MUST allow attendees to view their current registration status and payment record after payment.\n- **FR-012**: The system MUST support a “Pending Payment Confirmation” state when confirmation is delayed and resolve it upon receipt of confirmation.\n- **FR-013**: The system MUST block payment initiation when a registration is already “Paid/Confirmed” and display the paid status with the payment record.\n- **FR-014**: The system MUST treat payments pending confirmation for more than 24 hours as unpaid and notify the attendee.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Attendee**: Registered user who pays the registration fee.\n- **Registration**: The attendee’s registration record including category, fee, and status.\n- **Payment Transaction**: Record of a payment attempt, including amount, status, timestamp, and reference.\n- **Payment Status**: State of the payment (e.g., unpaid, pending confirmation, paid/confirmed).\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Attendees are already registered and have selected a registration category before payment.\n- Registration fees and currency are configured in the system before payment is initiated.\n- Refunds, chargebacks, and receipt generation are out of scope for this feature.\n- Only credit/debit card payments are in scope for this feature.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Online payment service availability.\n- Registration pricing configuration.\n- Authentication for attendee access.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: Successful payments result in a “Paid/Confirmed” status and a visible confirmation message for the attendee.\n- **SC-002**: Invalid, declined, or unavailable payment attempts leave registrations unpaid and show a clear message to the attendee.\n- **SC-003**: Duplicate payment confirmations do not create duplicate records or alter an already confirmed registration.\n- **SC-004**: Payments pending confirmation for more than 24 hours are marked unpaid and the attendee is notified to retry.\n"}}

Use-Case Traceability (NON-NEGOTIABLE)\nEvery feature or change MUST map to a specific use case file `UC-XX.md`. If a new\nuse case is introduced, a new `UC-XX.md` MUST be added and referenced in specs,\nplans, and tasks. No implementation is accepted without explicit use-case linkage.\n\n### II. Acceptance Tests as Contract\nAcceptance tests are the source of truth and live in `UC-XX-AT.md` files paired\nwith their use cases. Updates to behavior MUST update the corresponding\nacceptance test document before or alongside implementation, and a feature is\nonly complete when its acceptance criteria are demonstrably satisfied.\n\n### III. MVC Separation\nThe CMS MUST follow MVC architecture. Models encapsulate data and domain rules,\ncontrollers coordinate user interactions and application flow, and views render\npresentation only. Business logic in views is prohibited.\n\n### IV. Vanilla Web Stack Only\nImplementation MUST use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Frameworks, UI\nlibraries, and build-tool-dependent abstractions are not allowed unless the\nconstitution is amended to permit them.\n\n### V. Simplicity & Clarity\nPrefer the simplest structure that satisfies the use case and acceptance tests.\nAvoid unnecessary abstractions or premature generalization; clarity and\nreadability take precedence over cleverness.\n\n## Project Constraints\n\n- Use cases are stored in `UC-XX.md` and acceptance tests in `UC-XX-AT.md`.\n- Any new use case MUST follow the next sequential `UC-XX` identifier and include\n  a matching acceptance test file.\n- All project documentation (specs, plans, tasks) MUST reference the relevant\n  `UC-XX` identifiers for traceability.\n\n## Development Workflow & Quality Gates\n\n- Every plan and spec MUST include a constitution check validating: use-case\n  traceability, acceptance test coverage, MVC separation, and vanilla stack\n  compliance.\n- Tasks MUST include explicit steps to update/add `UC-XX.md` and `UC-XX-AT.md`\n  when behavior changes or new functionality is introduced.\n- Reviews MUST verify that acceptance tests reflect the intended behavior and\n  that implementation aligns with the mapped use cases.\n\n## Governance\n\n- This constitution supersedes all other project guidance.\n- Amendments require documentation of the rationale, scope, and migration plan\n  (if behavior changes or breaking constraints are introduced).\n- Semantic versioning applies: MAJOR for breaking governance changes, MINOR for\n  new/expanded principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications and wording.\n- Compliance is reviewed during planning and before acceptance of changes.\n\n**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-01-31 | **Last Amended**: 2026-01-31\n"}}

Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

(file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /root/493-lab/Lab2/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) When `SKILL.md` references relative paths (e.g., `scripts/foo.py`), resolve them relative to the skill directory listed above first, and only consider other paths if needed.\n  3) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  4) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  5) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
