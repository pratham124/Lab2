# UC-01 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

A user who does not yet have an account visits the Conference Management System website and chooses to register. The system responds by presenting a registration form requesting an email address and password. The user enters a valid, unique email address and a password that meets the system’s security requirements, then submits the form. The system verifies that the email address is correctly formatted and not already associated with an existing account. It also checks that the password satisfies the required security standards. After successful validation, the system creates a new user account and stores the user’s information securely in the database. The system then redirects the user to the login page, allowing the user to proceed with accessing CMS features.

## Alternative Path 4a — Email Address Already Registered

During registration, the user submits an email address that is already associated with an existing CMS account. When the system checks email uniqueness, it detects the conflict. The system rejects the registration attempt and displays an error message informing the user that the email address is already registered. The user remains on the registration page and is given the opportunity to correct the email address or abandon the registration process. No user account is created.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — Password Does Not Meet Security Requirements

The user submits the registration form with a password that does not meet the CMS security standards. The system detects the violation during password validation. The registration process is halted, and the system displays an error message explaining the password requirements. The user remains on the registration page and may enter a new password that satisfies the constraints. No data is saved until a valid password is provided.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error

After the user submits valid registration information, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to store the new account information in the database. The system aborts the registration process and displays a failure message indicating that registration could not be completed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The user account is not created, and the user may attempt to register again later.
