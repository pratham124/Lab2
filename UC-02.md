# UC-02 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

A registered user visits the Conference Management System website and chooses to log in. The system responds by displaying a login form requesting the user’s email address and password. The user enters valid credentials associated with an existing CMS account and submits the form. The system verifies that the provided email exists in the database and that the entered password matches the stored credentials. After successful authentication, the system establishes a user session and redirects the user to their dashboard, where authorized CMS features are accessible.

## Alternative Path 4a — Account Does Not Exist

The user attempts to log in using an email address that is not associated with any registered CMS account. During credential verification, the system fails to find a matching account for the provided email. The system rejects the login attempt and displays an error message indicating that the account does not exist. The user remains on the login page and may choose to re-enter credentials or abandon the login process. No user session is created.

---

## Alternative Path 4b — Incorrect Password

The user enters a valid registered email address but provides an incorrect password. When the system compares the submitted credentials with those stored in the database, the password verification fails. The system denies access and displays an error message indicating that the credentials are invalid. The user remains on the login page and is allowed to retry logging in. No user session is created.

---

## Alternative Path 4c — System or Database Error

After the user submits valid login credentials, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to verify the credentials against the database. The authentication process is aborted, and the system displays a login failure message indicating that the user cannot be logged in at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The user is not authenticated, and no session is established.
