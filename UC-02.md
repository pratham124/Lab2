# Use Case UC-02: Log In to CMS

**Goal in Context**: Allow a registered user to authenticate with email and password to access the CMS dashboard.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: User Goal
**Primary Actor**: Registered User
**Trigger**: The user selects the option to log in.

## Success End Condition

- The user is authenticated, a session is created, and dashboard access is granted.

## Failed End Condition

- The user is not authenticated, no session is created, and the user remains on the login page with user-safe feedback.

## Preconditions

- The user already has a registered CMS account.
- Authentication verification is available.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The user opens the login page.
2. The system displays a login form requesting email and password.
3. The user submits valid credentials.
4. The system normalizes email input and verifies the credentials.
5. The system creates an authenticated session.
6. The system redirects the user to the dashboard.

## Extensions

- **3a**: Required fields are missing.
  - **3a1**: The system displays a required-field message and does not attempt authentication.
- **4a**: The email is unknown.
  - **4a1**: The system displays a generic, user-safe message: "Invalid email or password."
- **4b**: The password is incorrect.
  - **4b1**: The system displays the same generic, user-safe message: "Invalid email or password."
- **4c**: Verification fails because of a system error or outage.
  - **4c1**: The system displays a user-safe failure message and records an internal error event.
- **4d**: Repeated failed attempts occur.
  - **4d1**: The system records each failed attempt without lockout in this scope.

## Related Information

- **Priority**: High
- **Frequency**: High
- **Open Issues**: Lockout/rate limiting/session-timeout rules are out of scope.

## Fully Dressed Scenarios

### Main Success

A registered user submits valid credentials. The system verifies credentials, creates a session, and redirects to the dashboard.

### Alternative 4a/4b: Invalid Credentials

If email is unknown or password is incorrect, the system responds with the same user-safe error message and keeps the user on login. No session is created.

### Alternative 4c: Verification Failure

If credential verification cannot be completed, the system shows a non-technical failure message, logs the internal failure event, and leaves the user unauthenticated.

### Alternative 3a: Missing Required Fields

If email or password is blank, the system shows a required-field message and blocks authentication.

### Alternative 4d: Repeated Failed Attempts

Repeated failed attempts are recorded for audit and troubleshooting, but no lockout is enforced in this feature.
