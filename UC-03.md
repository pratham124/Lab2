# UC-03 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

A registered user who is currently logged in navigates to the account settings section of the Conference Management System and selects the option to change their password. The system responds by displaying a password change form requesting the user’s current password and a new password. The user enters their current password along with a new password that meets the system’s security requirements and submits the form. The system verifies that the entered current password matches the password stored for the user’s account. It then validates the new password against the required security standards. After successful validation, the system updates the user’s password in the database and confirms that the password has been changed successfully. The user remains logged in and can continue using the system with the updated credentials.

## Alternative Path 4a — Incorrect Current Password

The registered user attempts to change their password but enters an incorrect current password in the password change form. When the system verifies the current password against the stored credentials, the verification fails. The system rejects the password change request and displays an error message indicating that the current password is invalid. The user remains on the password change page and may re-enter the correct current password or abandon the process. The user’s password remains unchanged.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — New Password Does Not Meet Security Requirements

The user submits the password change form with the correct current password but provides a new password that does not satisfy the CMS password security standards. During validation, the system detects that the new password is non-compliant. The system halts the password update process and displays an error message explaining the password requirements. The user remains on the password change page and may enter a new password that meets the required constraints. The existing password remains active.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error

After the user submits valid password change information, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to update the password in the database. The system aborts the password change operation and displays a failure message indicating that the password could not be changed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The user’s password remains unchanged, and the user may attempt to change it again later.
