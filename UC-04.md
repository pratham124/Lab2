# Use Case UC-04: Submit Paper for Review

**Goal in Context**: Allow an author to submit a paper manuscript along with required metadata so that the paper can enter the conference review process.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: User Goal
**Primary Actor**: Author
**Secondary Actors**: None
**Trigger**: The author selects the option to submit a new paper.

## Success End Condition

- The paper manuscript and all required metadata are successfully stored in the CMS database and the paper is marked as submitted for review.

## Failed End Condition

- The paper is not submitted, and the system informs the author of the reason for failure.

## Preconditions

- The author is a registered user and is logged in.
- The CMS paper submission service is available.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The author navigates to the paper submission section of the CMS.
2. The system displays the paper submission form requesting paper metadata and manuscript upload.
3. The author enters the required metadata, including title, affiliation, contact email, abstract, and keywords for the single submitting author.
4. The author uploads the paper manuscript in an accepted format (PDF, DOCX, or LaTeX ZIP, maximum 7 MB).
5. The author submits the paper.
6. The system validates that all required fields are completed and the uploaded file meets submission constraints.
7. The system stores the paper metadata and manuscript in the database.
8. The system confirms successful submission and redirects the author to a confirmation page before returning to their home page.

## Extensions

- **4a**: The uploaded file is not in an accepted format or exceeds size limits.
  - **4a1**: The system displays an error message describing the file requirements, including the 7 MB maximum size.
- **6a**: Required metadata fields are missing or invalid.
  - **6a1**: The system highlights each invalid field and shows an inline error label indicating what must be corrected.
- **6b**: A duplicate submission is detected within the same submission window using the match key {author + title} and/or manuscript content hash.
  - **6b1**: The system blocks the submission and informs the author that a submission already exists.
- **7a**: A system or database error occurs while saving the submission.
  - **7a1**: The system displays a user-safe, non-technical submission failure message instructing retry later or contact support, and logs the error.

## Related Information

- **Priority**: High
- **Frequency**: Medium
- **Open Issues**: Supported manuscript formats beyond those listed are not fully specified.

# UC-04 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An author who is logged into the Conference Management System decides to submit a paper for review. The author navigates to the paper submission section, where the system displays a submission form requesting paper metadata and a manuscript file. The author enters all required metadata, including authors’ names, affiliations, contact information, abstract, and keywords. The author then uploads the paper manuscript in an accepted file format and submits the form. The system validates that all required fields are completed and that the uploaded manuscript meets the submission constraints. After successful validation, the system stores the paper metadata and manuscript in the database and marks the paper as submitted for review. The system confirms the successful submission and redirects the author to their home page.

## Alternative Path 4a — Invalid or Oversized Manuscript File

The author uploads a manuscript file that is not in an accepted format or exceeds the 7 MB file size limit. When the system validates the uploaded file, it detects that the file does not meet the submission requirements. The system rejects the submission attempt and displays an error message explaining the acceptable file formats and size limits. The author remains on the submission page and may upload a corrected manuscript file or abandon the submission process. No paper information is stored.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — Missing or Invalid Metadata

The author submits the paper submission form without completing all required metadata fields or provides invalid information in one or more fields. During validation, the system detects missing or invalid metadata. The system halts the submission process, highlights each invalid field, and shows an inline error label indicating what must be corrected. The author remains on the submission page and may revise the metadata and resubmit the form. The paper is not saved as a submitted paper.

---

## Alternative Path 7a — System or Database Error

After the author submits valid metadata and a valid manuscript file, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to store the paper information in the database. The submission process is aborted, and the system displays a user-safe, non-technical failure message indicating that the paper could not be submitted at this time and advising the author to retry later or contact support. The error is logged for administrative review. The paper is not marked as submitted, and the author may attempt the submission again later.

---

## Alternative Path 6b — Duplicate Submission Within Submission Window

The author attempts to submit a paper that duplicates an existing submission within the same submission window based on the match key {author + title} and/or manuscript content hash. The system detects the duplicate submission and blocks the submission attempt. The system informs the author that a submission already exists. The author remains on the submission page and may abandon the submission process. No new paper information is stored.
