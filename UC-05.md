3. The author selects a manuscript file in an accepted format.
4. The system validates the file format and file size against submission rules.
5. The system uploads the file and associates it with the current paper submission.
6. The system confirms that the file upload was successful.

# UC-05 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An author who is logged into the Conference Management System is in the process of submitting a paper and chooses to upload a manuscript file. The system prompts the author to select a file from their local device. The author selects a manuscript file in an accepted format such as PDF, Word, or LaTeX. The system validates the selected file to ensure that its format and size comply with the submission rules. After successful validation, the system uploads the file and associates it with the current paper submission. The system then confirms that the manuscript upload was completed successfully, allowing the author to continue the submission process.

## Alternative Path 3a — Unsupported File Format

The author selects a manuscript file that is not in one of the accepted formats. When the system checks the file format, it detects that the file type is not supported. The system rejects the upload attempt and displays an error message explaining which file formats are acceptable. The author remains on the upload step and may choose a different file or abandon the upload. No file is stored or associated with the submission.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — File Exceeds Maximum Size Limit

The author selects a manuscript file that exceeds the maximum allowed file size. During validation, the system detects that the file size violates the submission constraints. The system halts the upload process and displays an error message indicating that the file is too large and specifying the maximum permitted size. The author remains on the upload step and may select a smaller file. No file is uploaded or stored.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — System or Network Error During Upload

After the author selects a valid manuscript file, the system begins the upload process but encounters a system or network error before the upload completes. The system aborts the upload and displays a failure message indicating that the file could not be uploaded at this time. The error is handled gracefully, and the author is given the option to retry the upload or abandon the process. No incomplete or corrupted file is associated with the submission.
