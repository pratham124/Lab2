# Use Case UC-06: Save Paper Submission Progress

**Goal in Context**: Allow an author to save a partially completed paper submission so that it can be completed and submitted later.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: Subfunction
**Primary Actor**: Author
**Secondary Actors**: None
**Trigger**: The author selects **Save Draft** on the submission form.

## Success End Condition

- The CMS stores a draft for the submission and the author can resume it later.

## Failed End Condition

- The draft is not saved and the author receives a clear reason.

## Preconditions

- The author is registered and logged in.
- The author is on the submission form.
- CMS persistence is available.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The author enters any subset of submission fields.
2. The author selects **Save Draft**.
3. The system trims whitespace and validates only provided fields.
4. The system creates or updates the draft for the submission.
5. The system shows visible save confirmation with a last-saved timestamp.

## Extensions

- **3a**: One or more provided fields are invalid.
  - **3a1**: The system shows field-level warnings and does not save.
- **4a**: A system/database error occurs while saving.
  - **4a1**: The system shows a safe failure message and logs the save failure.
- **4b**: Another author attempts to read/update the draft.
  - **4b1**: The system denies access and logs unauthorized access.
- **4c**: The author triggers rapid repeat saves.
  - **4c1**: The system handles idempotently and keeps one draft per submission.
- **4d**: A stale client saves over newer data.
  - **4d1**: The system applies last-write-wins and returns save confirmation.

## Business Rules

- Draft saves have no required fields.
- Only provided fields are validated.
- One draft exists per submission.
- Drafts do not auto-expire.

# UC-06 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An authenticated author starts a submission, enters partial metadata, and selects **Save Draft**. The CMS trims and validates only the fields the author provided, then stores the draft for that submission. The system confirms save success and shows when the draft was last saved so the author can safely continue later.

---

## Alternative Path 3a — Invalid Provided Data

The author enters an invalid provided value (for example, malformed contact email) and selects **Save Draft**. The system rejects the save, highlights the specific invalid fields, and keeps the author on the form so they can correct values.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — Storage Failure

During save, persistence fails. The system reports that the draft could not be saved, logs the failure for administrators, and does not leave a partial/corrupt draft.

---

## Alternative Path 4b — Unauthorized Access

A different author attempts to open or overwrite a draft they do not own. The system denies the request and logs the unauthorized attempt.
