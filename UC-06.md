# UC-06 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An author who is logged into the Conference Management System begins filling out a paper submission form but does not wish to complete the submission in one session. While entering paper metadata and other available information, the author selects the option to save the submission progress. The system performs a basic validation of the entered information to ensure that required fields do not contain invalid values. After successful validation, the system stores the partially completed submission as a draft associated with the author’s account. The system then confirms that the submission progress has been saved successfully, allowing the author to exit the system and resume the submission at a later time.

## Alternative Path 3a — Invalid or Inconsistent Information

The author attempts to save the submission progress while some of the entered information is invalid or inconsistent. During validation, the system detects the problematic fields. The system does not save the draft and displays a warning message indicating which fields contain invalid data and must be corrected before saving. The author remains on the submission form and may correct the information or abandon the save operation. No draft submission is stored.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — System or Database Error

After the author selects the option to save the submission progress and all entered information passes basic validation, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to store the draft submission in the database. The system aborts the save operation and displays a failure message indicating that the submission progress could not be saved at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The submission progress remains unsaved, and the author may attempt to save again later.
