# UC-07 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

After all required reviews for a submitted paper are completed, the editor records the final decision for the paper in the Conference Management System. The decision remains hidden from authors until it is officially published. When publication occurs, the system sends an email notification to the submitting author. The submitting author later logs in to the CMS and navigates to the list of submitted papers. The system displays the paper along with its final decision, clearly indicating whether the paper has been accepted or rejected.

## Alternative Path 4a — Notification Failure

The editor records and publishes the final decision for the paper. The system fails to send the email notification to the submitting author due to a temporary communication or email service issue. The failure is logged by the system for administrative review. Despite the notification failure, the final decision remains available in the CMS and is visible to the submitting author on later login.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — Author Does Not Log In Immediately

The editor records, saves, and publishes the final decision for the paper. The submitting author does not log in to the CMS immediately after publication. The system retains the decision securely in the database. When the submitting author eventually logs in and navigates to submitted papers later, the system displays the final decision without loss of information.

---

## Alternative Path 7a — System or Database Error While Retrieving Decision

The submitting author logs in to the CMS and navigates to submitted papers to view the final decision. When the system attempts to retrieve the decision information from the database, an internal system or database error occurs. The system is unable to display the decision and instead shows: "Decision temporarily unavailable. Please try again later." The error is logged for administrative review, and the author may attempt to view the decision again later.
