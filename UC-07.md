# UC-07 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

After all required reviews for a submitted paper are completed, the editor records the final decision for the paper in the Conference Management System. The system stores the decision in the database and notifies the author that a final decision is available. The author later logs in to the CMS and navigates to the list of their submitted papers. The system displays the paper along with its final decision, clearly indicating whether the paper has been accepted or rejected. The author is now informed of the outcome of the review process and can proceed accordingly.

## Alternative Path 3a — Notification Failure

The editor records the final decision for the paper, and the system successfully stores the decision in the database. However, the system fails to send the notification to the author due to a temporary communication or email service issue. The failure is logged by the system for administrative review. Despite the notification failure, the final decision remains available in the CMS. When the author later logs in and checks the list of submitted papers, the system displays the final decision correctly.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — Author Does Not Log In Immediately

The editor records and saves the final decision for the paper, and the system notifies the author that a decision is available. The author does not log in to the CMS immediately after the notification is sent. The system retains the decision securely in the database. When the author eventually logs in and navigates to their submitted papers at a later time, the system displays the final decision without any loss of information.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error While Retrieving Decision

The author logs in to the CMS and navigates to the list of submitted papers to view the final decision. When the system attempts to retrieve the decision information from the database, an internal system or database error occurs. The system is unable to display the decision and instead shows an error message indicating that the decision cannot be displayed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the author may attempt to view the decision again later.
