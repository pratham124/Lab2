# Use Case UC-08: Assign Reviewers to Submitted Papers

**Goal in Context**: Allow an editor to assign qualified reviewers to submitted papers so that each paper is evaluated fairly and according to conference rules.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: User Goal
**Primary Actor**: Editor
**Secondary Actors**: Reviewer, Email Notification System
**Trigger**: The editor selects the option to assign reviewers to a submitted paper.

## Success End Condition

- The required number of reviewers is successfully assigned to the paper.

## Failed End Condition

- Reviewers are not assigned to the paper, and the system informs the editor of the reason for failure.

## Preconditions

- The editor is a registered user and is logged in.
- The paper has been successfully submitted and is available for review assignment.
- A list of eligible reviewers exists in the CMS.
- The CMS reviewer assignment and notification services are available.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The editor navigates to the list of submitted papers.
2. The editor selects a paper that requires reviewer assignment.
3. The system displays a list of eligible reviewers.
4. The editor selects reviewers for the paper.
5. The system validates that the assignment satisfies conference rules.
6. The system assigns the selected reviewers to the paper.
7. The system confirms to the editor that the reviewers have been assigned successfully.
8. The system attempts to notify the assigned reviewers of their review invitations; if invitations fail, assignments remain saved, the failure is logged, and the editor sees a warning message.

## Extensions

- **4a**: The editor selects fewer or more reviewers than required.
  - **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the required number of reviewers.
- **5a**: A selected reviewer exceeds the maximum allowed review workload.
  - **5a1**: The system rejects the assignment and informs the editor of the workload violation.
- **6a**: A system or database error occurs while saving the assignments.
  - **6a1**: The system displays an assignment failure message and logs the error.

- **Frequency**: Medium
- **Open Issues**: Criteria for reviewer eligibility and conflict-of-interest checks are not fully specified.

# UC-08 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An editor who is logged into the Conference Management System reviews the list of submitted papers and identifies a paper that requires reviewer assignment. The editor selects the paper, and the system displays a list of eligible reviewers. Based on the reviewers’ expertise and availability, the editor selects the required number of reviewers for the paper. The system validates that the selected reviewers satisfy conference rules, including workload limits. After successful validation, the system assigns the reviewers to the paper and records the assignments in the database. The system confirms to the editor that the reviewers have been assigned successfully. The system then sends review invitations to the selected reviewers as a post-assignment action; notification failures do not undo assignments, are logged, and produce an editor-visible warning.

## Alternative Path 4a — Incorrect Number of Reviewers Selected

The editor selects a number of reviewers that is fewer or greater than the required number for a paper. When the system validates the selection, it detects that the number of reviewers does not meet conference rules. The system rejects the assignment attempt and displays an error message indicating the required number of reviewers. The editor remains on the reviewer selection interface and may adjust the selection to meet the requirement. No reviewer assignments are saved.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — Reviewer Workload Exceeds Limit

The editor selects reviewers for the paper, but one or more of the selected reviewers has already reached the maximum allowed number of assigned papers. During validation, the system detects the workload violation. The system rejects the assignment and displays an error message identifying the workload issue. The editor may choose a different reviewer or modify the selection. No assignments are saved.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error During Assignment

After the editor selects a valid set of reviewers, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to save the reviewer assignments in the database. The assignment process is aborted, and the system displays a failure message indicating that the reviewers could not be assigned at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The paper remains unassigned, and the editor may attempt the assignment again later.
