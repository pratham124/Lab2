# Use Case UC-09: Enforce Reviewer Workload Limit

**Goal in Context**: Prevent an editor from assigning more than the maximum allowed number of papers to a reviewer in order to ensure fair and balanced reviewer workload.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: Subfunction
**Primary Actor**: Editor
**Secondary Actors**: Reviewer
**Trigger**: The editor attempts to assign a reviewer to a paper during the reviewer assignment process.

## Success End Condition

- The system prevents any reviewer from being assigned more than five papers, and only valid reviewer assignments are allowed.

## Failed End Condition

- The system allows a reviewer to be assigned more than five papers, resulting in an unbalanced workload.

## Preconditions

- The editor is a registered user and is logged in.
- The reviewer assignment process is in progress.
- Reviewer workload data is available in the CMS.
- The CMS assignment validation service is available.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The editor selects a paper for reviewer assignment.
2. The editor selects a reviewer to assign to the paper.
3. The system checks the number of papers currently assigned to the selected reviewer.
4. The system determines that assigning the paper would exceed the maximum allowed workload.
5. The system prevents the assignment.
6. The system informs the editor that the reviewer has reached the maximum workload limit.

## Extensions

- **3a**: The reviewer has fewer than five assigned papers.
  - **3a1**: The system allows the assignment to proceed.
- **4a**: Reviewer workload information cannot be retrieved.
  - **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating that the workload cannot be verified and blocks the assignment.

## Related Information

- **Priority**: High
- **Frequency**: High
- **Open Issues**: Whether workload limits may be configurable in future versions is not specified.

# UC-09 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An editor who is logged into the Conference Management System is in the process of assigning reviewers to a submitted paper. The editor selects a reviewer to assign to the paper. The system checks the number of papers currently assigned to the selected reviewer and determines that the reviewer has already reached the maximum allowed workload of five papers. As a result, the system prevents the assignment from being completed. The system displays a message informing the editor that the selected reviewer cannot be assigned additional papers because the workload limit has been reached. The reviewer assignment is not saved, ensuring that reviewer workloads remain balanced.

## Alternative Path 3a — Reviewer Below Maximum Workload

The editor selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, and the system checks the reviewer’s current workload. The system determines that the reviewer has fewer than five assigned papers. Since assigning the paper would not exceed the workload limit, the system allows the assignment to proceed. The reviewer is successfully assigned to the paper, and the editor can continue with the reviewer assignment process.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — Unable to Retrieve Reviewer Workload Information

The editor selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, but the system encounters an error while attempting to retrieve the reviewer’s workload information from the database. Because the system cannot verify whether the assignment would exceed the workload limit, it blocks the assignment to prevent potential overload. The system displays an error message indicating that the reviewer workload cannot be verified at this time and logs the error for administrative review. The editor may attempt the assignment again later.
