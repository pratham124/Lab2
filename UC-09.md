# Use Case UC-09: Enforce Reviewer Workload Limit

**Goal in Context**: Prevent an editor from assigning more than the maximum allowed number of papers to a reviewer in order to ensure fair and balanced reviewer workload.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: Subfunction
**Primary Actor**: Editor
**Secondary Actors**: Reviewer
**Trigger**: The editor attempts to assign a reviewer to a paper during the reviewer assignment process.

## Success End Condition

- The system prevents any reviewer from being assigned more than five papers, and only valid reviewer assignments are allowed.

## Failed End Condition

- The system allows a reviewer to be assigned more than five papers (including under concurrency or when workload verification fails), resulting in an unbalanced workload.

## Preconditions

- The editor is a registered user and is logged in.
- The reviewer assignment process is in progress.
- Reviewer workload data is available in the CMS.
- The CMS assignment validation service is available.
- The workload limit is fixed at exactly five assigned papers for this release.
- Workload counts are per conference (not global).
- Workload counts reflect assigned papers only (no pending state).
- Only editors can initiate reviewer assignments that trigger workload checks.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The editor selects a paper for reviewer assignment.
2. The editor selects a reviewer from the list of selectable reviewers to assign to the paper.
3. The system checks the number of papers currently assigned to the selected reviewer in the conference.
4. The system determines that assigning the paper would exceed the maximum allowed workload.
5. The system prevents the assignment.
6. The system informs the editor with a non-technical message stating the reason (workload limit reached) and includes the numeric limit “5”, without exposing internal IDs or stack traces.

## Extensions

- **3a**: The reviewer has fewer than five assigned papers.
  - **3a1**: The system allows the assignment to proceed and saves the assignment.
- **3b**: The reviewer already has five assigned papers.
  - **3b1**: The reviewer is not selectable and is hidden from the reviewer selection list.
- **4a**: Reviewer workload information cannot be retrieved.
  - **4a1**: The system blocks the assignment, displays a non-technical error message indicating that the workload cannot be verified, and logs the failure for administrative review, without exposing internal IDs or stack traces.
- **4b**: Two editors attempt to assign the same reviewer concurrently.
  - **4b1**: The system allows only one assignment to succeed and blocks the other with the workload-limit message, ensuring the final workload does not exceed five.

## Related Information

- **Priority**: High
- **Frequency**: High
- **Open Issues**: Whether workload limits may be configurable in future versions is not specified.

# UC-09 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An editor who is logged into the Conference Management System is in the process of assigning reviewers to a submitted paper. The editor selects a reviewer from the list of selectable reviewers to assign to the paper. The system checks the number of papers currently assigned to the selected reviewer in the conference and determines that the reviewer has already reached the maximum allowed workload of five papers. As a result, the system prevents the assignment from being completed. The system displays a message informing the editor that the selected reviewer cannot be assigned additional papers because the workload limit has been reached. The reviewer assignment is not saved, ensuring that reviewer workloads remain balanced.

---

## Alternative Path 3a — Reviewer Below Maximum Workload

The editor selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, and the system checks the reviewer’s current workload. The system determines that the reviewer has fewer than five assigned papers. Since assigning the paper would not exceed the workload limit, the system allows the assignment to proceed and saves the assignment. The reviewer is successfully assigned to the paper, and the editor can continue with the reviewer assignment process.

---

## Alternative Path 3b — Reviewer At Maximum Workload Not Selectable

When building the reviewer selection list, the system identifies reviewers who already have five assigned papers in the conference. Those reviewers are not selectable and are hidden from the reviewer selection list, preventing an assignment attempt.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — Unable to Retrieve Reviewer Workload Information

The editor selects a reviewer to assign to a paper, but the system encounters an error while attempting to retrieve the reviewer’s workload information. Because the system cannot verify whether the assignment would exceed the workload limit, it blocks the assignment to prevent potential overload. The system displays an error message indicating that the reviewer workload cannot be verified at this time and logs the failure for administrative review. The editor may attempt the assignment again later.

---

## Alternative Path 4b — Concurrent Assignment Attempts

Two editors attempt to assign the same reviewer at the same time. The system enforces the workload limit so that only one assignment succeeds and the other is blocked with the workload-limit message. The reviewer’s final workload does not exceed five assigned papers.
