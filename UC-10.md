# Use Case UC-10: Receive Assignment Rule Violation Notification

**Goal in Context**: Inform the editor when a reviewer assignment violates conference rules so the editor can correct the assignment before it is saved.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: Subfunction
**Primary Actor**: Editor
**Secondary Actors**: None
**Trigger**: The editor attempts to save a reviewer assignment that violates an assignment rule.

## Success End Condition

- The system detects the assignment rule violation, blocks the invalid assignment from being saved, and notifies the editor with a clear message describing the violation.

## Failed End Condition

- The system fails to notify the editor of the violation and/or allows an invalid assignment to be saved.

## Preconditions

- The editor is a registered user and is logged in.
- The editor is performing reviewer assignment for a submitted paper.
- Assignment rule validation is available in the CMS.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The editor selects a paper for reviewer assignment.
2. The editor selects reviewers and attempts to save the assignment.
3. The system validates the assignment against conference rules.
4. The system detects a rule violation.
5. The system blocks the assignment from being saved.
6. The system displays a notification to the editor describing the violation.

## Extensions

- **4a**: Multiple assignment rule violations are detected.
  - **4a1**: The system displays notifications for each violation so the editor can correct them.
- **3a**: A system or database error occurs during rule validation.
  - **3a1**: The system displays an error message indicating validation cannot be completed and blocks saving the assignment.

## Related Information

- **Priority**: High
- **Frequency**: High
- **Open Issues**: Specific UI requirements for how violations are displayed and whether violations are logged for audit are not specified.

# UC-10 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An editor who is logged into the Conference Management System is assigning reviewers to a submitted paper. After selecting the reviewers, the editor attempts to save the assignment. The system automatically validates the assignment against the conference rules, such as the required number of reviewers and reviewer workload limits. During validation, the system detects that the assignment violates one or more rules. The system blocks the assignment from being saved and immediately displays a clear notification to the editor describing the specific rule violation. The editor is informed of the issue and can modify the assignment to correct the violation before attempting to save again.

## Alternative Path 4a — Multiple Assignment Rule Violations Detected

While attempting to save a reviewer assignment, the editor selects reviewers in a way that violates more than one assignment rule, such as selecting too many reviewers and including a reviewer who has exceeded the workload limit. When the system performs validation, it detects multiple rule violations. The system blocks the assignment and displays notifications describing each violation individually. This allows the editor to clearly understand all issues that must be corrected before the assignment can be saved. No reviewer assignments are stored until all violations are resolved.

## Alternative Path 3a — System or Database Error During Rule Validation

The editor selects reviewers and attempts to save the assignment. During the validation process, the system encounters an internal error or is unable to access required data needed to validate the assignment rules. Because the system cannot reliably determine whether the assignment is valid, it blocks the assignment from being saved. The system displays an error message informing the editor that assignment validation could not be completed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the editor may attempt the assignment again later.
