# Use Case UC-11: Receive Review Invitation

**Goal in Context**: A reviewer receives and responds to review invitations from editor assignments.
**Primary Actor**: Reviewer
**Secondary Actors**: Editor, Notification Service

## Preconditions

- Reviewer is authenticated in CMS.
- Editor assignment creates a review invitation.
- Invitation is linked to a paper and response due date.

## Main Success Scenario

1. Editor assigns reviewer to a paper.
2. System creates a `pending` invitation with a response due date.
3. System attempts to notify the reviewer (email or configured channel).
4. Reviewer logs in and opens Review Invitations.
5. System shows pending invitations by default, newest first, with pagination after 20 items.
6. Reviewer uses keyboard or mouse to Accept or Reject an invitation.
7. System updates invitation status and reflects change in list/API.

## Extensions

- **3a Notification failure**: Failure is logged; invitation remains available in CMS.
- **4a Delayed login**: Invitation stays pending until due date.
- **5a Retrieval failure**: UI shows generic retry message without internal details.
- **5b Unauthorized access**: Non-invited reviewer receives forbidden response and event is audit logged.
- **5c Due date passed**: Pending invitation is auto-marked declined on refresh.

## Postconditions

- Reviewer can view and process invitations securely.
- Invitation status is accurate (`pending`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `declined`).
- Notification attempt outcomes are recorded.
