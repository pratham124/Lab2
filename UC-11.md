# UC-11 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An editor assigns a reviewer to a submitted paper in the Conference Management System. The system creates a review invitation for the reviewer and sends a notification to the reviewer using the contact information associated with their account. The reviewer receives the invitation and later logs in to the CMS. Upon accessing their dashboard or list of review tasks, the reviewer sees the pending review invitation. The system displays the details of the invitation along with clear options to accept or reject the review request. The reviewer is now able to respond to the invitation according to their availability.

## Alternative Path 3a — Review Invitation Notification Failure

The editor assigns the reviewer to a paper, and the system successfully creates the review invitation. However, the system fails to send the notification to the reviewer due to a temporary issue with the notification service. The failure is logged by the system for administrative review. Despite the notification failure, the review invitation remains stored in the CMS. When the reviewer later logs in and accesses their review invitations, the system displays the pending invitation normally.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — Reviewer Does Not Log In Immediately

After the system sends the review invitation, the reviewer does not log in to the CMS immediately. The invitation remains in a pending state in the system. At a later time, when the reviewer logs in and navigates to their review invitations, the system displays the pending invitation. The reviewer can then choose to accept or reject the review request without any loss of information.

---

## Alternative Path 7a — System or Database Error While Retrieving Invitation

The reviewer logs in to the CMS and navigates to the list of review invitations. When the system attempts to retrieve the invitation information from the database, an internal system or database error occurs. The system is unable to display the invitation and instead shows an error message indicating that the invitation cannot be displayed at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the reviewer may attempt to view the invitation again later.
