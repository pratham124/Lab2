# Use Case UC-12: Access Assigned Papers for Review

**Goal in Context**: Allow a reviewer to access the papers that have been assigned to them so that they can review the papers and complete their review tasks.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: User Goal
**Primary Actor**: Reviewer

3. The system retrieves the list of papers assigned to the reviewer.
4. The system displays the assigned papers by title only.
5. The reviewer selects a paper from the list.

# UC-12 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

A reviewer who has previously accepted one or more review invitations logs in to the Conference Management System. After authentication, the reviewer navigates to their list of assigned review tasks. The system retrieves the list of papers that have been assigned to the reviewer and displays them clearly. The reviewer selects one of the assigned papers from the list. The system then displays the full content of the selected paper along with the relevant information needed for review. The reviewer is now able to read and evaluate the paper as part of the review process.
The system provides view-only access to the paper content and does not offer a download option.

## Alternative Path 3a — No Assigned Papers

The reviewer logs in to the CMS and navigates to the list of assigned review tasks. When the system retrieves the reviewer’s assignments, it determines that no papers are currently assigned to the reviewer. The system displays a message indicating that there are no papers available for review at this time. The reviewer cannot proceed with reviewing papers and may return later when assignments become available.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — System or Database Error While Retrieving Assigned Papers

The reviewer logs in to the CMS and navigates to the list of assigned review tasks. When the system attempts to retrieve the list of assigned papers from the database, an internal system or database error occurs. The system is unable to display the assigned papers and instead shows an error message indicating that the papers cannot be retrieved at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the reviewer may attempt to access the assigned papers again later.

## Alternative Path 6a — Unauthorized Access to an Unassigned Paper

The reviewer logs in to the CMS and attempts to access a paper that is not assigned to them, either by selecting an invalid link or by directly navigating to the paper’s URL. The system detects that the reviewer is not authorized to access the requested paper. The system denies access (treat as 403) and displays an “Access denied” message while keeping the reviewer within reviewer pages. The reviewer is prevented from viewing the paper and can return to their list of assigned papers.

---

## Alternative Path 6b — Attempt to Download a Manuscript

The reviewer attempts to download a manuscript from an assigned paper. The system does not provide a download option and maintains view-only access to the paper content. The reviewer can continue viewing the paper within the system.
