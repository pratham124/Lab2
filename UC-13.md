# UC-13 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

A reviewer who has accepted a review invitation logs in to the Conference Management System and navigates to their list of assigned papers. The reviewer selects one of the assigned papers and is presented with the corresponding review form. The reviewer completes all required sections of the form, providing evaluations and comments as requested. After completing the form, the reviewer submits it. The system validates that all required fields are completed and that the entered data is valid. Upon successful validation, the system stores the completed review in the database and confirms that the review has been submitted successfully. The submitted review is then made available to the editor for assessment as part of the paper decision process.

## Alternative Path 5a — Incomplete or Invalid Review Form

The reviewer opens the review form for an assigned paper but submits the form without completing all required fields or with invalid input. During validation, the system detects the missing or invalid information. The system rejects the submission and displays an error message indicating which fields must be corrected. The reviewer remains on the review form page and may complete or correct the required fields before attempting to submit the review again. The review is not stored.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error During Review Submission

After the reviewer submits a fully completed and valid review form, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to store the review in the database. The system aborts the submission process and displays a failure message indicating that the review could not be submitted at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The reviewer’s review is not saved, and the reviewer may attempt to submit the review again later.

---

## Alternative Path 3a — Unauthorized Review Submission

The reviewer attempts to submit a review for a paper that is not assigned to them, either by accessing an invalid link or by attempting to manipulate the submission process. The system detects that the reviewer is not authorized to submit a review for the selected paper. The system denies the submission and displays an authorization error message. The review is not accepted or stored, and the reviewer is prevented from proceeding with the submission.
