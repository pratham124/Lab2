## Main Success Scenario

An editor logs in to the Conference Management System and navigates to the list of submitted papers. The editor selects a paper that is under consideration for a final decision. The system displays the paper’s details and provides an option to view completed reviews. The editor chooses to view the reviews, and the system retrieves all completed reviews associated with the selected paper. The system then displays the full content of each completed review, allowing the editor to read reviewer evaluations and comments. With access to all completed reviews, the editor is able to assess the paper and proceed toward making a final decision.

## Alternative Path 2a — No Completed Reviews Available

The editor selects a paper and requests to view its completed reviews. When the system retrieves review information, it determines that no reviews have been submitted for the paper yet. The system displays a message indicating that no completed reviews are currently available. The editor cannot review evaluations at this time and may return later once reviews are submitted.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error While Retrieving Reviews

The editor selects a paper and attempts to view its completed reviews. During the retrieval process, the system encounters an internal error or database failure. As a result, the system is unable to display the reviews and instead shows an error message indicating that the reviews cannot be retrieved at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The editor may attempt to view the reviews again later.

---

## Alternative Path 3a — Unauthorized Access to Reviews

The editor attempts to view completed reviews for a paper that they are not authorized to manage, either by selecting an invalid paper or by directly accessing a restricted review page. The system detects that the editor does not have the necessary permissions to view the reviews for the selected paper. The system denies access and displays an authorization error message. The editor is prevented from viewing the reviews and is redirected to an appropriate page or error screen.
