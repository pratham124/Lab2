# Use Case UC-15: Send Acceptance or Rejection Decision to Author

**Goal in Context**: Allow an editor to send the final acceptance or rejection decision for a paper to the author(s) so that they are informed of the outcome.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: User Goal
**Primary Actor**: Editor
**Secondary Actors**: Author, Email Notification System
**Trigger**: The editor selects the option to send the final decision for a paper after reviews are complete and a decision has been made.

## Success End Condition

- The final decision (acceptance or rejection) is stored in the CMS and successfully communicated to the author(s).

## Failed End Condition

- The final decision is not communicated to the author(s), and the system informs the editor of the failure.

## Preconditions

- The editor is a registered user and is logged in.
- The paper exists in the CMS and is available for decision processing.
- The required reviews for the paper have been completed and are available to the editor.
- The editor has determined the final decision (accept or reject).
- The author(s) have valid contact information (e.g., email) stored in the CMS.
- The CMS decision management and notification services are available.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The editor logs in to the CMS.
2. The editor navigates to the list of submitted papers.
3. The editor selects a paper for which a final decision is ready.
4. The system displays the paper details and provides an option to record and send a final decision.
5. The editor selects the final decision (accept or reject) and confirms sending it.
6. The system stores the final decision in the database.
7. The system sends the decision notification to the author(s).
8. The system confirms to the editor that the decision has been sent successfully.

## Extensions

- **6a**: A system or database error occurs while storing the final decision.
  - **6a1**: The system displays a failure message indicating the decision cannot be saved or sent at this time and logs the error.

# UC-15 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

After reviewing all completed evaluations for a submitted paper, an editor logs in to the Conference Management System and navigates to the list of submitted papers. The editor selects a paper for which a final decision has been made. The system displays the paper’s details along with an option to record and send a final decision. The editor selects either **accept** or **reject** and confirms the action. The system stores the final decision in the database and sends a notification to the author(s) informing them of the outcome. The system then confirms to the editor that the decision has been successfully sent and recorded.

## Alternative Path 5a — Reviews Not Yet Completed

The editor attempts to send a final decision for a paper before all required reviews have been completed. When the system checks the review status, it detects that one or more reviews are still pending. The system blocks the decision-sending action and displays a message indicating that a final decision cannot be sent until all required reviews are completed. The editor is returned to the paper details page and may wait until reviews are finished before retrying.

---

## Alternative Path 7a — Notification Delivery Failure

The editor selects and confirms a final decision for a paper, and the system successfully stores the decision in the database. However, the system encounters an error while attempting to send the notification to the author(s), such as an email service failure. The system logs the notification failure and displays a message informing the editor that the decision could not be delivered to the author(s) at this time. Despite the notification failure, the final decision remains stored and viewable in the CMS, and the editor may attempt to resend the notification later.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — System or Database Error While Storing Decision

The editor selects a final decision and attempts to send it to the author(s). During the process of saving the decision, the system encounters an internal system or database error. As a result, the decision is neither stored nor sent. The system displays an error message indicating that the decision could not be saved or sent at this time and logs the error for administrative review. The editor may attempt to send the decision again later once the issue is resolved.
