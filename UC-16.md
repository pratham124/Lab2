# Use Case UC-16: Generate Conference Schedule

**Goal in Context**: Allow an administrator to generate a conference schedule so that accepted papers are assigned appropriate presentation time slots.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: User Goal
**Primary Actor**: Administrator
**Secondary Actors**: None
**Trigger**: The administrator selects the option to generate the conference schedule.

## Success End Condition

- A complete conference schedule is generated and stored in the CMS, with accepted papers assigned to specific sessions and time slots.

## Failed End Condition

- The conference schedule is not generated, and the system informs the administrator of the reason for failure.

## Preconditions

- The administrator is a registered user and is logged in.
- The conference has accepted papers available for scheduling.
- Required scheduling parameters (e.g., conference dates, session lengths, available rooms) are defined in the CMS.
- The CMS scheduling service is available.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The administrator logs in to the CMS.
2. The administrator navigates to the conference administration section.
3. The administrator selects the option to generate the conference schedule.
4. The system retrieves accepted papers and scheduling parameters.
5. The system applies scheduling rules to assign papers to sessions and time slots.
6. The system generates the conference schedule.
7. The system stores the generated schedule in the database.
8. The system displays the generated schedule to the administrator for review.

## Extensions

- **4a**: Required scheduling parameters are missing or incomplete.
  - **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating which parameters must be defined before scheduling.
- **5a**: The system cannot generate a valid schedule due to conflicts or constraints.
  - **5a1**: The system displays a failure message explaining that scheduling conflicts prevent schedule generation.
- **7a**: A system or database error occurs while saving the schedule.
  - **7a1**: The system displays a schedule generation failure message and logs the error.

## Related Information

- **Priority**: High
- **Frequency**: Low
- **Open Issues**: Specific scheduling algorithms, conflict resolution strategies, and support for manual adjustments after generation are not specified.

# UC-16 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An administrator logs in to the Conference Management System and navigates to the conference administration section. The administrator selects the option to generate the conference schedule. The system retrieves all accepted papers along with the predefined scheduling parameters, such as conference dates, session durations, and available rooms. Using the configured scheduling rules, the system assigns each accepted paper to an appropriate session and time slot while respecting the defined constraints. After completing the assignment process, the system generates a complete conference schedule and stores it in the database. The system then displays the generated schedule to the administrator for review, showing sessions, time slots, and assigned papers.

## Alternative Path 4a — Missing or Incomplete Scheduling Parameters

The administrator initiates the schedule generation process, but some required scheduling parameters have not been defined, such as missing conference dates or unavailable room information. When the system attempts to retrieve the necessary parameters, it detects that the information is incomplete. The system halts the schedule generation process and displays an error message indicating which scheduling parameters must be defined before a schedule can be generated. No schedule is created, and the administrator may update the missing information and try again.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — Scheduling Conflicts Prevent Generation

The administrator starts the schedule generation process with all required parameters defined. While applying the scheduling rules, the system encounters conflicts or constraints that prevent a valid schedule from being produced, such as too many accepted papers for the available time slots or overlapping constraints. The system is unable to resolve these conflicts automatically and aborts the generation process. The system displays a failure message explaining that scheduling conflicts prevent the schedule from being generated. No schedule is stored, and the administrator may adjust parameters or constraints before retrying.

---

## Alternative Path 7a — System or Database Error While Saving Schedule

After successfully generating a valid conference schedule, the system encounters an internal error while attempting to save the schedule to the database. As a result, the generated schedule is not stored. The system displays a schedule generation failure message indicating that the schedule could not be saved at this time and logs the error for administrative review. The administrator does not see a persisted schedule and may attempt to generate the schedule again later once the issue is resolved.
