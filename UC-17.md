# Use Case UC-17: Edit Generated Conference Schedule

**Goal in Context**: Allow an editor to modify an already generated conference schedule so that scheduling conflicts can be resolved and adjustments can be made.
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)
**Level**: User Goal
**Primary Actor**: Editor
**Secondary Actors**: None
**Trigger**: The editor selects the option to edit the generated conference schedule.

## Success End Condition

- The conference schedule is successfully updated with the editor’s changes and stored in the CMS.

## Failed End Condition

- The schedule changes are not saved, and the system informs the editor of the reason for failure.

## Preconditions

- The editor is a registered user and is logged in.
- A conference schedule has already been generated and exists in the CMS.
- The editor has permission to modify the conference schedule.
- The CMS scheduling and persistence services are available.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The editor logs in to the CMS.
2. The editor navigates to the conference schedule view.
3. The system displays the current conference schedule.
4. The editor selects a session, paper, or time slot to modify.
5. The editor updates scheduling details (e.g., time slot, session, or room assignment).
6. The system validates the updated schedule for basic consistency.
7. The system saves the updated schedule.
8. The system confirms that the schedule has been updated successfully.

## Extensions

- **6a**: The updated schedule introduces a conflict or violates scheduling constraints.
  - **6a1**: The system blocks saving the changes and displays an error message describing the conflict.
- **7a**: A system or database error occurs while saving the updated schedule.
  - **7a1**: The system displays a save failure message and logs the error.
- **4a**: The editor attempts to edit a schedule element that no longer exists.
  - **4a1**: The system displays an error message indicating the selected item cannot be edited.
- **5a**: The schedule has changed since the editor loaded it (stale edit).
  - **5a1**: The system blocks saving and prompts the editor to refresh/reload the schedule.
- **2a**: A non-editor attempts to edit the schedule.
  - **2a1**: The system blocks the action, saves no changes, and displays an access-denied message.

## Related Information

- **Priority**: Medium
- **Frequency**: Low
- **Open Issues**: The extent of allowed edits (manual drag-and-drop vs. form-based) is not specified.

# UC-17 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An editor logs in to the Conference Management System and navigates to the conference schedule view. The system displays the currently generated schedule, showing sessions, time slots, rooms, and assigned papers. The editor identifies a scheduling issue and selects a specific schedule element to modify, such as moving a paper to a different session or changing its time slot or room. The editor updates the scheduling details using the provided editing controls. The system validates the updated schedule to ensure basic consistency, such as avoiding overlapping assignments within the same room. After successful validation, the system saves the updated schedule and confirms to the editor that the changes have been applied successfully. The revised schedule is now stored and reflected in the CMS.

## Alternative Path 6a — Conflict Introduced by Schedule Edit

The editor selects a schedule element and modifies its time slot or room assignment in a way that introduces a conflict, such as overlapping sessions in the same room or assigning two papers to the same time slot within a single session. When the system validates the updated schedule, it detects the conflict. The system blocks the save operation and displays an error message describing the scheduling conflict that must be resolved. The editor remains in the schedule editing view and may revise the changes or cancel the edit. No updates are saved.

---

## Alternative Path 7a — System or Database Error While Saving Schedule

The editor makes valid changes to the conference schedule and attempts to save them. During the save operation, the system encounters an internal system or database error. The system fails to store the updated schedule and displays a failure message indicating that the schedule changes could not be saved at this time. The error is logged for administrative review. The schedule remains unchanged, and the editor may attempt to save the changes again later.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — Selected Schedule Element No Longer Exists

The editor attempts to modify a schedule element that is no longer present in the current schedule, such as a session or paper that was removed or altered by another administrative action. When the system processes the edit request, it determines that the selected element does not exist. The system displays an error message indicating that the selected schedule item cannot be edited. The editor is returned to the schedule view and may select a different element to modify.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — Schedule Changed Since Load (Stale Edit)

The editor loads the schedule and begins an edit. Before saving, another change is made to the schedule. When the editor attempts to save the stale edit, the system detects the schedule has changed, blocks the save, and prompts the editor to refresh or reload the schedule. No changes from the stale edit are saved.

---

## Alternative Path 2a — Non-Editor Attempts to Edit Schedule

A user without editor permissions attempts to access or save schedule edits. The system blocks the action, saves no changes, and displays an access-denied message. The schedule remains unchanged.
