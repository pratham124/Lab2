# UC-18 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

After the conference schedule has been finalized, an administrator or editor publishes the final schedule in the Conference Management System. The system generates notifications for all authors who have accepted papers. An author receives a notification informing them that the final conference schedule is available. The author logs in to the CMS and navigates to their list of submissions. The author selects one of their accepted papers. The system displays the presentation details for the selected paper, including the presentation date, time slot, session, and location. With this information, the author knows exactly when and where to present their paper.

## Alternative Path 3a — Author Does Not Log In Immediately

The system publishes the final conference schedule and sends a notification to the author. The author does not log in to the CMS immediately after receiving the notification. The notification remains available in the system. At a later time, when the author logs in and navigates to their submissions, the system displays the presentation details for the accepted paper. The author can still access the final schedule information without any loss of data.

---

## Alternative Path 6a — Author Has Multiple Accepted Papers

The author logs in to the CMS after the final schedule has been published and navigates to their list of submissions. The author has multiple accepted papers. The system displays each accepted paper along with its corresponding presentation details, including date, time, session, and location. The author can review the schedule for each paper separately to understand when and where each presentation will take place.

---

## Alternative Path 2a — Schedule Notification Not Sent

The conference schedule is finalized and published, but the system fails to send the schedule notification to the author due to a notification service issue. The failure is logged by the system. Even though no notification is received, the author later logs in to the CMS and navigates to their list of submissions. The system displays the presentation details for the accepted paper, allowing the author to access the final schedule information despite the notification failure.

---

## Alternative Path 7a — System or Database Error While Retrieving Schedule Details

The author logs in to the CMS and navigates to their list of submissions to view presentation details. When the system attempts to retrieve the schedule information for the accepted paper, a system or database error occurs. The system is unable to display the schedule details and instead shows an error message indicating that the schedule information cannot be retrieved at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the author may attempt to access the schedule details again later.
