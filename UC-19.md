# UC-19 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An attendee accesses the Conference Management System and selects the option to view the conference schedule. The system retrieves the published conference schedule and displays it in a clear and organized format, showing sessions, presentation times, and locations. The attendee browses through the schedule, scrolling and navigating between sessions and time slots to identify presentations of interest. Using the displayed information, the attendee is able to plan their attendance at the conference effectively.

## Alternative Path 3a — Schedule Not Yet Published

The attendee accesses the Conference Management System and attempts to view the conference schedule before it has been published. When the system checks the schedule status, it determines that the schedule is not yet available. The system displays a message indicating that the conference schedule has not yet been published and advises the attendee to check back later. No schedule information is shown.

---

## Alternative Path 3b — System or Database Error While Retrieving Schedule

The attendee selects the option to view the conference schedule, but during retrieval, the system encounters an internal system or database error. As a result, the system cannot display the schedule and instead shows an error message indicating that the schedule cannot be retrieved at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the attendee may attempt to view the schedule again later.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — Filter or View Schedule by Day or Session

The attendee accesses the published conference schedule and chooses to apply available viewing options, such as filtering the schedule by a specific day or session. The system updates the displayed schedule to reflect the selected filter or view option, showing only the relevant sessions and presentations. The attendee continues browsing the filtered schedule to plan their attendance more efficiently.
