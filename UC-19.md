# Use Case UC-19: View Published Conference Schedule

**Goal in Context**: Allow an attendee to view the published conference schedule and plan attendance.  
**Scope**: Conference Management System (CMS)  
**Level**: User Goal  
**Primary Actor**: Attendee  
**Secondary Actors**: None  
**Trigger**: The attendee opens the schedule page.

## Success End Condition

- The attendee can view a published schedule with entries that include time and location.

## Failed End Condition

- The schedule cannot be displayed and the system shows a safe, user-facing message.

## Preconditions

- The schedule endpoint `/schedule/published` is publicly accessible (no login required).
- A conference schedule may or may not be published.

## Main Success Scenario

1. The attendee opens the schedule page without authentication.
2. The client requests `GET /schedule/published`.
3. The system returns `200` with `PublishedSchedule`.
4. The UI displays entries with time and location.
5. Entries missing time or location are hidden.

## Extensions

- **3a**: Schedule unpublished or absent.
  - **3a1**: `GET /schedule/published` returns `404` with `ErrorMessage`.
  - **3a2**: UI shows a clear “not yet published” message and no entries.

- **3b**: Retrieval failure (temporary service issue).
  - **3b1**: `GET /schedule/published` returns `503` with `ErrorMessage`.
  - **3b2**: UI shows message and retry action when `canRetry=true`.
  - **3b3**: Retry action re-issues `GET /schedule/published`.

- **4a**: Optional filters (if available).
  - **4a1**: UI sends `day` and/or `session` query params.
  - **4a2**: If filters match no entries, system returns `200` with `entries=[]`.
  - **4a3**: UI shows “no results” and reset action.
