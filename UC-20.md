# UC-20 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An attendee accesses the Conference Management System and selects the option to view conference registration prices. The system retrieves the current registration pricing information from its data store. The system then displays the registration prices in a clear and understandable format, showing the cost of attending the conference. The attendee reviews the pricing information to determine the cost and plan accordingly.

## Alternative Path 3a — Registration Pricing Not Yet Defined

The attendee accesses the Conference Management System and selects the option to view registration prices. When the system attempts to retrieve pricing information, it determines that registration prices have not yet been defined or published. The system displays a message informing the attendee that pricing is not available. The attendee is unable to view pricing details and may check back later once prices are published.

---

## Alternative Path 3b — System or Database Error While Retrieving Pricing Information

The attendee selects the option to view registration prices, but the system encounters an internal system or database error while retrieving the pricing information. As a result, the system cannot display the prices and instead shows an error message indicating that registration pricing information cannot be retrieved at this time. The error is logged for administrative review, and the attendee may attempt to view the pricing information again later.

---

## Alternative Path 4a — View Pricing by Category

The attendee accesses the registration pricing page and chooses to view pricing details by category, such as student, professional, or early registration, if such options are supported by the system. The system updates the displayed pricing information to reflect the selected category, showing the corresponding prices. The attendee reviews the category-specific pricing to better understand the available registration options.

---

## Alternative Path 3c — No Active Categories With Prices

The attendee selects the option to view registration prices, but the system determines that no active pricing categories with prices exist. The system displays a message indicating that pricing is not available. The attendee is unable to view pricing details and may check back later once prices are published.

---

## Alternative Path 4b — Inactive Category Hidden

The attendee views registration pricing information, and one or more pricing categories are marked inactive. The system hides the inactive categories from the attendee view and only displays active categories. The attendee reviews the remaining visible pricing options.

---

## Alternative Path 4c — Category Without Price Amount

The attendee views registration pricing information, and a pricing category exists without a price amount. The system displays the category label with “Not available” in place of the price amount. The attendee sees that the category is currently unavailable.
