# UC-21 — Fully Dressed Scenario Narratives

## Main Success Scenario

An attendee who has registered for the conference logs in to the Conference Management System and navigates to the registration section. The system displays the selected registration category along with the corresponding registration fee and available online payment options. The attendee chooses an online payment method and is redirected to a secure payment gateway. The attendee enters valid payment details and confirms the transaction. The payment gateway processes the payment successfully and sends a confirmation back to the CMS. The CMS records the successful payment, updates the attendee’s registration status to “Paid” or “Confirmed,” and displays a confirmation message to the attendee indicating that the registration fee has been paid and their attendance is confirmed.

## Alternative Path 6a — Invalid or Incomplete Payment Details

The attendee selects an online payment method and is redirected to the payment gateway. While entering payment information, the attendee provides invalid or incomplete details, such as an incorrect card number or missing required fields. The payment gateway detects the issue and rejects the transaction. An error message is displayed indicating that the payment details are invalid or incomplete. The attendee’s payment is not processed, their registration remains unpaid, and the attendee may correct the information and retry the payment.

---

## Alternative Path 7a — Payment Declined by Payment Gateway

The attendee enters valid payment details and submits the payment. The payment gateway processes the request but declines the transaction due to reasons such as insufficient funds or card restrictions. The payment gateway notifies the CMS of the declined transaction. The system informs the attendee that the payment was declined and that their registration has not been completed. The attendee remains in an unpaid registration state and may attempt to pay again using a different payment method.

---

## Alternative Path 5a — Payment Gateway Unavailable

The attendee selects the option to pay the registration fee online, but when the system attempts to connect to the payment gateway, the gateway is unavailable due to a service outage or network issue. The system is unable to redirect the attendee to the payment gateway and instead displays an error message indicating that online payment is temporarily unavailable. The attendee’s registration status remains unpaid, and the attendee may try again later when the payment service is restored.
