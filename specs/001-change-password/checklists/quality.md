# Requirements Quality Checklist: Change Account Password

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of password-change requirements before implementation
**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-change-password/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all user-facing actions in the change-password flow explicitly specified (form access, inputs, submission, confirmation)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001..FR-005]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all error conditions called out with expected requirement coverage (incorrect current password, policy failure, system error)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK003 Are session behavior requirements fully stated for after a successful password change? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009..FR-011]
- [ ] CHK004 Are password policy requirements complete (length, character rules, difference from current)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK005 Are out-of-scope exclusions explicitly listed for nearby adjacent functionality (reset, admin change, MFA)? [Completeness, Spec §Out of Scope]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Are password policy terms measurable and unambiguous (e.g., “at least 1 letter and 1 number”)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK007 Is “keep all existing sessions active” precise enough to avoid alternate interpretations (e.g., across devices, browsers)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the error presentation requirement explicit about inline-only feedback with no summary? [Clarity, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK009 Are the success confirmation requirements described without vague language? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do the clarifications and functional requirements align on session behavior? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-009..FR-011]
- [ ] CHK011 Do the edge cases match the stated password policy and validation rules? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK012 Are user stories consistent with functional requirements for retries and errors? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §FR-006..FR-010]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable and tied to primary user outcomes? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-004]
- [ ] CHK014 Is SC-001’s timing target clearly anchored to a defined start/end point? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK015 Is the improvement target in SC-004 defined without ambiguous baselines? [Clarity, Spec §SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows all described in requirements (not only in narrative)? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §FR-001..FR-008]
- [ ] CHK017 Are recovery or retry expectations explicitly stated for user-correctable errors? [Coverage, Spec §FR-006..FR-007]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are the listed edge cases translated into explicit requirements or acceptance criteria? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK019 Is the “success but confirmation fails to display” case specified with required behavior? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK020 Are performance expectations beyond SC-001 explicitly specified (e.g., system response timing) or intentionally omitted? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK021 Are security/privacy requirements beyond password policy specified (e.g., logging, audit, data protection) or explicitly out of scope? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK022 Are assumptions about existing storage and session handling documented and validated? [Assumption, Spec §Use Case Mapping Notes]
- [ ] CHK023 Are dependencies on existing account settings/navigation flows stated? [Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK024 Is there any conflict between “no lockout” and security posture expectations that should be explicitly reconciled? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK025 Are any terms like “clear error message” or “confirm success” defined with objective criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005..FR-007]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK026 Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-03.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK027 Acceptance tests identified: `UC-03-AT.md` referenced [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK028 MVC separation implications captured in plan context [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK029 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only constraint acknowledged [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
