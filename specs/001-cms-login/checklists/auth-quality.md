**Purpose**: Validate the clarity, completeness, and consistency of login requirements
**Created**: February 1, 2026
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are required login input fields explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 Are success outcomes defined for valid credential submission? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are error outcomes defined for account-not-found and invalid-password cases? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK004 Are failure outcomes defined for system verification errors? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK005 Are post-failure behaviors (stay on login, retry) defined? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for protecting dashboard access after failed login? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK007 Are error event recording requirements defined for system verification failures? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK008 Are credential handling protections (no plaintext storage/logging/transmission) explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK009 Is the term “login failure message” defined with user-facing content expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK010 Are “authenticated” and “session” defined with clear boundaries for access? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK011 Is “credentials are invalid” specified with the exact error scope (email vs password vs both)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the “account does not exist” message expectation specific enough to avoid ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK013 Is the requirement to avoid policy-internal details in password feedback clearly defined? [Clarity, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK014 Do requirements and user stories describe the same login success outcome? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK015 Are error handling requirements consistent across user stories and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK016 Do success criteria align with the functional requirements for login success and failure? [Consistency, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-002, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK017 Are security/privacy requirements consistent with error messaging requirements (no internal details)? [Consistency, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK018 Are success criteria measurable and tied to specific login outcomes? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK019 Is the user satisfaction target defined with a clear survey method or measurement approach? [Clarity, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK020 Is the support-ticket reduction metric bounded by a specific baseline and measurement window? [Clarity, Spec §SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are primary login flows fully covered by requirements and acceptance scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK022 Are alternate flows for unknown email and incorrect password fully covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK023 Are exception flows for verification failures fully covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK024 Are authenticated-user redirect behaviors defined (logged-in user visiting login page)? [Gap, Spec §UC-02-AT]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK025 Are requirements specified for missing email or password submissions? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK026 Are requirements specified for repeated failed login attempts in a short period? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK027 Are requirements specified for whitespace handling in email input? [Gap, Spec §UC-02-AT]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK028 Are performance expectations for login clearly measurable beyond the 30-second success target? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK029 Are availability expectations defined for the authentication service? [Gap, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK030 Are security requirements stated for credential handling and error messaging? [Completeness, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK031 Are assumptions about lockout, rate limiting, and session timeout explicitly bounded as out of scope? [Clarity, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK032 Are dependencies on user registry and credential verification explicitly scoped? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK033 Is the scope for “Login Attempt” records defined (required vs optional, retention)? [Ambiguity, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK034 Are error messages consistent with acceptance tests for non-technical language? [Consistency, Spec §UC-02-AT]
- [ ] CHK035 Are registration-related error message requirements applicable to login, or should they be scoped separately? [Ambiguity, Spec §Security & Privacy Considerations]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK036 Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-02.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK037 Acceptance tests identified in `UC-02-AT.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK038 MVC separation requirement acknowledged for planned work [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK039 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks) [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
