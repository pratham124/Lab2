# Requirements Quality Checklist: Edit Generated Conference Schedule

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of schedule-editing requirements (conflict handling, concurrency, permissions, and visibility)
**Created**: February 3, 2026
**Feature**: `specs/001-edit-conference-schedule/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements defined for blocking conflicting room/time and paper/time edits? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Is stale-edit handling (schedule changed since load) explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK003 Are permissions/role boundaries for edit access explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK004 Is visibility timing for saved edits specified for all viewers? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is the term "conflict" defined with concrete, testable conditions? [Clarity, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK006 Is "immediately" for visibility clarified with a measurable expectation? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "clear, actionable message" defined with required content elements? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do conflict rules align between Assumptions and Functional Requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions; Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the edit scope (reassign only) consistent across User Stories and Functional Requirements? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing; Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK010 Is stale-edit blocking consistent between Clarifications and Functional Requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications; Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK011 Is visibility timing consistent with any persistence assumptions? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions; Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK012 Are success criteria measurable for completion time and success rate of valid edits? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK013 Do success criteria include measurable outcomes for conflict blocking and stale-edit handling? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are primary edit-and-save scenarios fully specified with given/when/then? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK015 Are conflict scenarios specified with required user feedback and non-save behavior? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK016 Are stale-edit (schedule changed since load) scenarios explicitly covered? [Gap, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK017 Are unauthorized edit attempts covered with expected outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are double-save/rapid save behaviors explicitly defined in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK019 Are missing-item edit attempts defined with expected outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK020 Are save-failure recovery expectations defined (no partial update, message content)? [Coverage, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK021 Are performance expectations for validation/save responsiveness quantified? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK022 Are security/privacy requirements beyond role checks (e.g., audit visibility or data exposure limits) explicitly stated or intentionally excluded? [Gap, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK023 Are dependencies and assumptions (existing schedule, persistence availability) validated or called out for risk? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions; Spec §Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK024 Are any remaining vague terms (e.g., "basic consistency") clarified or replaced with concrete rules? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK025 Use-case traceability is explicitly mapped to `UC-17.md` and `UC-17-AT.md`. [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK026 Is MVC separation explicitly stated in requirements or assumptions for this feature? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK027 Is the vanilla HTML/CSS/JS constraint explicitly stated in requirements or assumptions? [Gap]
