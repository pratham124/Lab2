# Requirements Quality Checklist: Generate Conference Schedule

**Purpose**: Validate completeness and clarity of core UC-16 functional scope and flows.
**Created**: February 3, 2026
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-generate-conference-schedule/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all required scheduling parameters explicitly listed, not implied? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK002 Is the schedule generation trigger/action fully described for the administrator? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK003 Are storage requirements for the generated schedule explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the schedule display requirement defined as part of the generation flow? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is “complete schedule” defined with measurable criteria beyond “assigned to sessions/time slots”? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK006 Is the term “accepted papers” unambiguous and linked to a clear status definition? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK007 Are failure messages defined with sufficient specificity to be testable? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do the user stories and functional requirements describe the same generation flow without contradictions? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-001..FR-009]
- [ ] CHK009 Are failure outcomes consistent between edge cases and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-011]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK010 Are success criteria aligned with the primary UC-16 outcome (stored schedule with assignments)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK011 Are success criteria stated so they can be objectively validated without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001..SC-006]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK012 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows all represented in scenarios or edge cases? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK013 Is the persistence failure path covered as a required behavior? [Coverage, Spec §FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Are missing-parameter scenarios fully specified (what is missing, what the user sees, and what is not saved)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK015 Are unsatisfiable-constraint scenarios defined with expected outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK016 Are duplicate-assignment prevention requirements explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK017 Are performance targets tied to user-visible outcomes rather than system internals? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK018 Is availability scope (conference setup period) defined clearly enough to be testable? [Clarity, Spec §SC-006]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK019 Are all assumptions necessary for schedule generation explicitly documented and bounded? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK020 Are dependencies on existing CMS data/storage explicitly acknowledged in requirements or assumptions? [Dependency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-008]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK021 Are there any terms like “appropriate” or “complete” that lack measurable definitions? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK022 Are any requirements stronger than UC-16 wording without explicit justification? [Conflict, Spec §User Stories, Spec §FRs]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK023 Is the feature explicitly mapped to `UC-16.md` for traceability? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK024 Are acceptance tests in `UC-16-AT.md` identified as the contract? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK025 Are MVC boundaries and vanilla stack constraints referenced in planning docs? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
