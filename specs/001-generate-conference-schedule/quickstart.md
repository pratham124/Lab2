## References
- Spec: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-generate-conference-schedule/spec.md
- Use Case: /root/493-lab/Lab2/UC-16.md
- Acceptance Tests: /root/493-lab/Lab2/UC-16-AT.md

## Verification Steps
1. Ensure scheduling parameters are defined for a conference.
2. Log in as an administrator and trigger schedule generation.
3. Confirm the schedule is generated, stored, and displayed.
4. Re-run acceptance tests in `UC-16-AT.md` to validate failure paths.
