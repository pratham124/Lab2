# Requirements Quality Checklist: Paper Submission

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, consistency, and measurability of requirements for UC-04 paper submission
**Created**: February 1, 2026
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all required metadata fields explicitly listed and complete (title, abstract, keywords, affiliation, contact email)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Is the accepted manuscript format list fully specified (PDF, DOCX, LaTeX ZIP) with no contradictions elsewhere? [Completeness, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK003 Are all user-facing failure messages covered for validation, duplicate, and save errors? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “duplicate submission” defined with unambiguous matching criteria (e.g., title vs. content) in requirements text? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK005 Is “submission window” defined with precise boundaries (open/close dates) and referenced consistently? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK006 Are file-size constraints quantified in a single consistent unit and location (7 MB) without conflicting values? [Clarity, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Do user stories, functional requirements, and edge cases agree on validation behavior and error presentation? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK008 Does the single-author constraint appear consistently across requirements and assumptions without co-author references? [Consistency, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §Assumptions]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria measurable and directly tied to the primary submission flow? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK010 Are acceptance scenarios sufficient to validate each functional requirement or is traceability missing? [Traceability, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are alternate/error flows (invalid metadata, invalid file, system failure, duplicate) fully captured in requirements, not only in edge cases? [Coverage, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK012 Are recovery expectations after blocked submission (e.g., remain on form vs. redirect) explicitly stated for all failure types? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are edge cases about session expiry, upload interruption, invalid LaTeX ZIP, and duplicate attempts specified with expected outcomes? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK014 Are performance expectations for peak submission week quantified beyond success-rate metrics? [Gap, Non-Functional]
- [ ] CHK015 Are security/privacy requirements for stored manuscripts and contact info explicitly documented? [Gap, Non-Functional]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK016 Are all assumptions (file size, formats, single-author, submission window) validated or referenced as agreed constraints? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK017 Are dependencies on authentication and storage explicitly tied to requirements that rely on them? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Are any vague terms (e.g., “clear confirmation,” “highlight invalid fields”) defined with objective criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK019 Is use-case traceability explicitly documented (UC-04) within the spec? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK020 Are acceptance tests (UC-04-AT) referenced as the contract for behavior? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK021 Is MVC separation assumed or documented for implementation planning? [Gap, Constitution]
- [ ] CHK022 Is the vanilla HTML/CSS/JS constraint captured in planning context? [Gap, Constitution]
