## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK017 Are success criteria measurable and time-bound where needed? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

- [ ] CHK019 Are acceptance scenarios defined for each user story and individually testable? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are alternate flows for delivery failure, generation failure, and duplicate confirmations explicitly addressed? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK021 Are recovery expectations after failures (e.g., re-access in CMS) defined as requirements? [Coverage, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK022 Are post-retention access expectations defined for attendees? [Coverage, Spec §FR-011]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK023 Are boundary conditions for retention expiry and access messaging specified? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK024 Are unauthorized access attempts addressed with explicit user-facing outcomes? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK025 Are duplicate confirmations explicitly handled without creating inconsistent states? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-012]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK026 Are timing requirements for ticket visibility quantified and linked to success criteria? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK027 Are delivery success targets defined with measurable thresholds? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-002]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK029 Are external dependency assumptions (payment gateway, email delivery) explicitly documented? [Dependencies, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK030 Are assumptions about attendee authentication and access clearly stated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK031 Are any remaining ambiguous terms (e.g., “immediately,” “clear error”) clarified or referenced with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK032 Is there any conflict between retention assumptions and success criteria or user stories? [Conflict, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies, Spec §User Story 1]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK033 Is use-case traceability explicitly documented in the spec? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK034 Are acceptance tests referenced and aligned with the defined requirements? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
