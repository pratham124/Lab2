# Requirements Quality Checklist: Receive Review Invitation

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of requirements across UX, API/contract, and security dimensions.
**Created**: February 02, 2026
**Feature**: `/root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-review-invitation/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all invitation list fields required for decision-making explicitly specified (title, status, due date)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK002 Is the filtering behavior for non-pending invitations fully specified (available statuses and default behavior)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK003 Are notification content requirements (what the reviewer is told) explicitly defined? [Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is the term “generic, user-friendly error message with retry guidance” concretely defined (exact message or required elements)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK005 Is “invitation visible within 1 minute of assignment” clearly scoped to visible list view (not notification delivery)? [Clarity, Spec §SC-002]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK006 Do invitation status definitions align across requirements and entities (pending/accepted/rejected/declined/expired)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-007, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK007 Are invitation detail visibility rules (title only before acceptance; abstract after acceptance) consistent across stories and requirements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-010, Spec §User Story 1]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK008 Are success criteria measurable and tied to the primary user goals (finding and responding to invitations)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK009 Are security-related success criteria explicitly tied to the access rules in requirements? [Traceability, Spec §SC-004, Spec §FR-006]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK010 Are alternate flows specified for notification failures and delayed login beyond a single sentence (expected user-visible outcomes)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK011 Are exception flows specified for retrieval errors with clear user-facing behavior and no sensitive details? [Coverage, Spec §FR-008]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK012 Are boundary conditions specified for multiple invitations (ordering, pagination, or maximum list size)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK013 Is the behavior defined when the due date passes while the reviewer is viewing the list? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK014 Are performance expectations for list loading explicitly quantified (beyond usability timing in SC-001)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK015 Are accessibility requirements (keyboard access, focus order) explicitly stated for invitation actions? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK016 Are assumptions about notification delivery channels and reliability documented and scoped? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK017 Are dependencies on existing CMS datastore capabilities (invitation status, due dates) explicitly documented? [Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK018 Is the use of “declined” vs “rejected” clearly distinguished to avoid conflicting states? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK019 Are any requirements that imply acceptance/rejection behavior explicitly marked as out of scope? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §User Story 3]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK020 Are UC-11 and UC-11-AT explicitly referenced as the authoritative sources for this feature? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK021 Is MVC separation documented as a requirement or planning constraint for implementation? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK022 Is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS compliance explicitly stated as a constraint for this feature? [Gap]
