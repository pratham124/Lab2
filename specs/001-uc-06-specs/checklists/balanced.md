**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, and coverage of requirements for the draft save/resume feature
**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-uc-06-specs/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements specified for saving a draft with partial or empty data? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for resuming a draft with previously saved values? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-005]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK003 Is “basic consistency validation” defined clearly enough to avoid differing interpretations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK004 Is the “one draft per submission” rule unambiguous across user stories and requirements? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-011]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK005 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same save failure behavior? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-008/FR-009]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK006 Are success criteria measurable and testable without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK007 Are exception scenarios specified for validation failure and storage failure? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK008 Are authorization rules specified for access to drafts owned by another author? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-006]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK009 Is the rapid double-save case covered with explicit requirement text, not just listed as an edge case? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK010 Are logging requirements for failures and unauthorized access explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK011 Is the performance target for saving drafts quantified? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK012 Are dependencies on authentication and storage availability explicitly captured? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK013 Is concurrent save conflict handling explicitly resolved or intentionally deferred with rationale? [Ambiguity, Spec §Clarifications]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK014 Is the feature mapped to a specific use case (UC-06) in the spec? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK015 Are acceptance tests (UC-06-AT) explicitly referenced as the contract? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
