# Requirements Quality Checklist: Receive Final Paper Decision

**Purpose**: Lightweight requirements-quality review for UC-07 decision visibility, notifications, and error handling.
**Created**: 2026-02-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are notification requirements defined for both delivery success and failure paths? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003/FR-004]
- [ ] CHK002 Are access-control requirements defined for non-submitting authors attempting to view decisions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK003 Are publish-timing requirements defined for when a decision becomes visible? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements stated for email notification recipients (and exclusions)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK005 Are error-message requirements defined for decision retrieval failures? [Completeness, Spec §FR-007/FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is “officially published to authors” defined with clear criteria (e.g., explicit state or trigger)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the term “submitting author” unambiguous given the single-author assumption? [Clarity, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK008 Is “user-friendly error message” defined with specific expectations (content, tone, or constraints)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK009 Do notification requirements in user stories and FRs align on timing and channel? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2/FR-003]
- [ ] CHK010 Do access-control statements align across user stories, FRs, and assumptions about single-author submissions? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 3/FR-006/Assumptions]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK011 Are success criteria measurable without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001–SC-004]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the notification success metric tied to the “published” trigger rather than “recorded” to avoid timing ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §SC-003/FR-003]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are primary, notification, and failure scenarios each covered with acceptance scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK014 Are unauthorized-access scenarios explicitly addressed in requirements (not just in user stories)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-006]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK015 Are notification failure and delayed-viewing scenarios explicitly captured in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §FR-004/FR-005]
- [ ] CHK016 Is the “decision retrieval error” scenario captured with both visibility and messaging requirements? [Coverage, Spec §FR-007/FR-008]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK017 Are security/privacy expectations explicitly stated for decision access (beyond a single authorization rule)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK018 Are performance/latency expectations defined for decision viewing or notifications? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK019 Are dependencies on editor actions and notification service availability stated and scoped? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK020 Are assumptions about single-author submissions and no reviewer comments reflected consistently in requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions/FR-009]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK021 Are there any terms that could be interpreted multiple ways (e.g., “published”, “submission”, “decision available”)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK022 Are there any conflicts between success criteria timing and functional requirements timing? [Conflict, Spec §SC-003/FR-003]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK023 Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-07.md` [Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK024 Acceptance tests identified in `UC-07-AT.md` [Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK025 MVC separation planned (model/view/controller boundaries) [Plan §Project Structure]
- [ ] CHK026 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks) [Plan §Technical Context]
