# Requirements Quality Checklist: Assign Reviewers to Papers

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of requirements across spec, plan, data model, contracts, and quickstart.
**Created**: February 2, 2026
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-uc-08-docs/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all primary user goals from the spec captured as functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Are post-assignment invitation behaviors explicitly specified as non-blocking? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006/FR-006a]
- [ ] CHK003 Are all validation rules from acceptance tests reflected in requirements (reviewer count, workload, re-assignment)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003–FR-004]
- [ ] CHK004 Are success and failure end conditions explicitly documented in the spec or use case summary? [Gap, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK005 Are all assumptions in the spec listed and justified with scope boundaries? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is “assignment success” defined in a single, unambiguous statement? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK007 Are terms like “eligible reviewer” and “workload limit” defined with objective criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002/FR-004]
- [ ] CHK008 Is “standard responsiveness” clarified or intentionally left as non-requirement? [Clarity, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK009 Are notification failure behaviors stated without conflicting language across sections? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006a, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same reviewer count rule? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK011 Do edge cases align with acceptance scenarios and not introduce new rules? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK012 Do success criteria avoid implying invitations are required for assignment success? [Consistency, Spec §SC-005/SC-006, Spec §FR-005]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable without implementation-specific metrics? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK014 Are acceptance scenarios testable and mapped to at least one functional requirement? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK015 Is the “warning + retry” behavior measurable or scoped as a qualitative expectation? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006a]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows explicitly covered in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK017 Are recovery flows defined for temporary system failures during assignment save? [Gap, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK018 Are scenarios for insufficient eligible reviewers and re-assignment clearly documented? [Coverage, Spec §FR-003a/FR-003b, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are boundary conditions for reviewer workload (e.g., 4→5) specified in requirements or acceptance criteria? [Coverage, Spec §FR-004, Spec §Acceptance Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK020 Are partial-save protections explicitly stated for all validation failures? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK021 Are notification failure outcomes defined without implying rollback? [Consistency, Spec §FR-006a, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK022 Is the decision to omit explicit performance targets documented and justified? [Clarity, Spec §Non-Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK023 Are security/access control requirements for editor actions explicitly stated or referenced? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK024 Are availability or retry expectations for notifications defined at a requirements level? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006a]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK025 Are external dependency expectations (notification system availability) documented as assumptions? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK026 Are data consistency assumptions between assignments and invitations documented? [Assumption, Spec §FR-005/FR-006a]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK027 Are any terms in the data model (e.g., “eligibilityStatus”) defined in the spec or explicitly out of scope? [Ambiguity, Data Model §Reviewer, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK028 Are contract error responses aligned with requirement language for validation vs system errors? [Consistency, Contracts §Reviewer Assignment API, Spec §FR-008]

## Cross-Document Traceability

- [ ] CHK029 Do plan summaries and technical context reflect the non-blocking invitation requirement? [Consistency, Plan §Summary/Technical Context, Spec §FR-006a]
- [ ] CHK030 Are data-model validation rules traceable to specific functional requirements? [Traceability, Data Model §Entities, Spec §FR-003–FR-004]
- [ ] CHK031 Are contract endpoints traceable to user actions described in user stories? [Traceability, Contracts §Reviewer Assignment API, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK032 Does the quickstart reference all acceptance tests relevant to the requirements? [Completeness, Quickstart §Steps, Spec §Use Case Mapping]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK033 Is use-case traceability explicitly documented in the spec and plan? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping, Plan §Constitution Check]
- [ ] CHK034 Are acceptance tests treated as the contract in plan and quickstart wording? [Consistency, Plan §Summary, Quickstart §Purpose]
- [ ] CHK035 Is MVC separation addressed as a requirement or constraint in planning? [Completeness, Plan §Technical Context/Constitution Check]
- [ ] CHK036 Is the vanilla HTML/CSS/JS constraint documented in planning? [Completeness, Plan §Technical Context]

## Notes

- Mark items complete with `[x]` when satisfied by the written requirements.
- Add short notes inline where gaps or ambiguities are found.
