# Requirements Quality Checklist: Enforce Reviewer Workload Limit

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of the UC-09 requirements before implementation
**Created**: February 2, 2026
**Feature**: `specs/001-uc-09/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all core behaviors from user stories reflected in functional requirements? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1–3, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK002 Are reviewer selection list rules explicitly specified (hidden at limit)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK003 Are per-conference scoping rules stated for workload counts? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK004 Are logging requirements defined for workload verification failures? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK005 Are entity definitions sufficient to support workload counting (Reviewer, Paper, Assignment, Workload Count)? [Completeness, Spec §Key Entities]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is the workload limit expressed as an exact, fixed number for this release? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK007 Is “assigned papers only (no pending state)” unambiguously stated? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK008 Are “hidden” vs “not selectable” reviewer behaviors described without ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK009 Is “workload verification failure” defined clearly enough to guide handling? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, Spec §User Story 3]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do the Clarifications align with Functional Requirements without conflict? [Consistency, Spec §Clarifications, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK011 Do Success Criteria align with Functional Requirements (same limits, same scope)? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §FR-001–FR-011]
- [ ] CHK012 Are Edge Cases consistent with User Stories and FRs (no new behavior)? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §User Stories]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are success criteria measurable and directly tied to specified behaviors? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK014 Can each FR be validated by at least one UC-09-AT scenario without interpretation? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements, Spec §Use Case Mapping]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK015 Are primary, alternate, and exception flows all defined? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK016 Is the concurrency scenario explicitly addressed as a required behavior? [Coverage, Spec §FR-007, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK017 Is the “reviewer at limit” selection behavior covered as a scenario? [Coverage, Spec §FR-011, Spec §Clarifications]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are boundary conditions for 0, 4, and 5 assignments explicitly specified? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK019 Is failure to retrieve workload data explicitly defined as a blocking condition? [Coverage, Spec §FR-003, Spec §User Story 3]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK020 Are any performance expectations required, or is their absence explicitly acceptable? [Gap, Spec §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK021 Are operational logging requirements scoped (what is logged, who reviews, retention)? [Gap, Spec §FR-010]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK022 Are dependencies on existing auth/roles explicitly stated and sufficient? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK023 Are assumptions about data availability (workload data) explicit and testable? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions & Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK024 Are any terms like “workload verification failure” or “clear message” further quantified? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-004]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK025 Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-09.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK026 Acceptance tests updated in `UC-09-AT.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK027 MVC separation planned for implementation notes [Gap, Spec §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK028 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks) [Traceability, Spec §Technical Context]
