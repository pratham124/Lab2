# Requirements Quality Checklist: Assignment Rule Violation Notifications

**Purpose**: Validate the completeness, clarity, and consistency of UC-10 requirements before implementation.
**Created**: February 2, 2026
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-uc-10-docs/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] CHK001 Are all required notification channels explicitly specified (including exclusions such as email/admin alerts)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all audit log fields required for a violation event explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK003 Is the audit log retention period specified and unambiguous? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for what happens after repeated invalid save attempts? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for handling multiple workload-limit violations in a single save? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for rule changes between selection and save? [Gap]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 Is “clear, actionable” notification language defined with specific criteria (content elements, tone, examples)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK008 Is “validation cannot be completed” clarified with user-facing wording requirements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK009 Is “no partial assignments” defined clearly (e.g., atomic save behavior described in plain terms)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK010 Is “feedback on every invalid save attempt” clarified for repeat attempts (same vs. updated messaging)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do notification timing statements align between FR-003 and SC-001 (save-time and within 2 seconds)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003; Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK012 Are audit logging requirements consistent between FR-008/FR-009 and Key Entities (Audit Log Entry)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-008; Spec §FR-009; Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK013 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same blocking behavior (immediate block vs. deferred handling)? [Consistency, Spec §User Stories; Spec §FR-002]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK014 Are success criteria measurable without implementation details (timing, rates, pass/fail thresholds)? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001–SC-004]
- [ ] CHK015 Is the 90% correction success metric defined with a measurable observation window or sample size? [Clarity, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK016 Is “clear violation message” defined in acceptance criteria with observable properties? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 Are primary, multiple-violation, and validation-unavailable scenarios all represented in requirements and acceptance scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK018 Are correction-loop requirements fully specified (including when messages clear and when success confirmation appears)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004; Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK019 Are non-functional scenarios (latency, retention, audit logging) explicitly tied to user workflows? [Coverage, Spec §SC-001; Spec §FR-009]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are repeated invalid save attempts handled with explicit requirements? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK021 Are multiple reviewer workload violations in a single save explicitly addressed? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK022 Are rule configuration changes between selection and save explicitly addressed? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK023 Is the 2-second notification timing target explicitly scoped to save-time validation only? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK024 Are audit log retention requirements defined without conflicting assumptions? [Consistency, Spec §FR-009; Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK025 Are privacy or access control requirements for audit logs specified (who can view audit logs)? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK026 Are assumptions about rule values (e.g., required reviewer count) explicitly identified as external configuration? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK027 Are dependencies for validation availability described at a requirements level (without implementation details)? [Coverage, Spec §FR-005]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK028 Are all ambiguous adjectives (e.g., “clear,” “actionable”) either defined or replaced with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK029 Are there any conflicts between user stories and functional requirements regarding notification behavior? [Conflict]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK030 Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-10.md` [Traceability]
- [ ] CHK031 Acceptance tests updated in `UC-10-AT.md` [Traceability]
- [ ] CHK032 MVC separation validated (model/view/controller) [Traceability, Plan §Constitution Check]
- [ ] CHK033 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks) [Traceability, Plan §Constitution Check]
