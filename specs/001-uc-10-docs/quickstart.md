# Quickstart: Assignment Rule Violation Notifications

## Purpose
Validate documentation and planned behavior for UC-10 rule violation notifications and audit logging.

## Steps
1. Review `/root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-uc-10-docs/spec.md` for clarified notification content, save-time validation, atomic saves, and audit log fields/access.
2. Confirm UC alignment in `/root/493-lab/Lab2/UC-10.md` and `/root/493-lab/Lab2/UC-10-AT.md`, including repeated invalid attempts and rule-change handling.
3. Check contracts in `/root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-uc-10-docs/contracts/assignment-rules.yaml` for multi-violation responses and message field requirements.
4. Verify audit logging scope, admin-only visibility, and 1-year retention are reflected across docs.
