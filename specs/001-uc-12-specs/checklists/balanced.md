# Balanced Requirements Checklist: Access Assigned Papers for Review

**Purpose**: Validate clarity, completeness, and consistency of access control, UX states, and non-functional requirements in the spec
**Created**: 2026-02-02
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-uc-12-specs/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are requirements specified for the assigned papers list, including what is shown in the list? [Completeness, Spec §Requirements/FR-001, FR-002]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements specified for viewing an assigned paper’s content (view-only) without download capability? [Completeness, Spec §Requirements/FR-003, FR-003a]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements specified for unauthorized access attempts to unassigned papers? [Completeness, Spec §Requirements/FR-004]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements specified for empty-state behavior when no assignments exist? [Completeness, Spec §Requirements/FR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements specified for retrieval errors when assigned papers cannot be fetched? [Completeness, Spec §Requirements/FR-006]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements specified for missing manuscript behavior? [Completeness, Spec §Requirements/FR-007]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 Is “view-only access” clearly defined without conflicting download allowances? [Clarity, Spec §Requirements/FR-003a, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the “Access denied” response defined with enough detail to distinguish it from not-found behavior? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios/User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK009 Is the identifier shown in the list unambiguous (title only) and applied consistently? [Clarity, Spec §Requirements/FR-002]
- [ ] CHK010 Are time-based goals (e.g., list access within 5 seconds) quantified and measurable? [Clarity, Spec §Success Criteria/SC-001]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same access constraints (assigned-only, view-only)? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios, Spec §Requirements]
- [ ] CHK012 Do assumptions and functional requirements align on “no download” scope? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions, Spec §Requirements/FR-003a]
- [ ] CHK013 Are edge cases aligned with corresponding acceptance scenarios and requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §User Scenarios]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK014 Are user story acceptance scenarios testable without inferred behavior beyond the spec? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Scenarios]
- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria measurable and tied to user outcomes rather than implementation details? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary flows (list assigned papers; open assigned paper) fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios/User Story 1-2]
- [ ] CHK017 Are exception flows for no assignments, retrieval failure, and unauthorized access fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios/User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK018 Are recovery expectations specified after errors (e.g., safe return to list)? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios/User Story 2-3]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are edge cases for multiple assigned papers and missing manuscripts explicitly addressed? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK020 Are direct-link access attempts to unassigned papers covered without ambiguity? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK021 Are performance and availability requirements specified with measurable thresholds? [Non-Functional, Spec §Success Criteria/SC-001, SC-005]
- [ ] CHK022 Are security/privacy expectations for access control explicitly stated (assigned-only access)? [Non-Functional, Spec §Requirements/FR-004]
- [ ] CHK023 Are accessibility or localization requirements explicitly declared or intentionally excluded? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK024 Are key assumptions documented and non-conflicting with requirements (no downloads, reviewer-only)? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK025 Are dependencies on existing CMS data (reviewer, paper, assignment, manuscript) explicitly acknowledged? [Dependency, Spec §Key Entities]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK026 Are any terms like “clear error” or “safe path back” defined with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §Requirements/FR-006, FR-007]
- [ ] CHK027 Is the scope boundary for metadata shown with papers explicitly defined (beyond title)? [Gap, Spec §Requirements/FR-002]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK028 Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-12.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK029 Acceptance tests updated in `UC-12-AT.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK030 MVC separation validated at requirements level (no view/controller mixing in requirements) [Constitution]
- [ ] CHK031 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks implied in requirements) [Constitution]
