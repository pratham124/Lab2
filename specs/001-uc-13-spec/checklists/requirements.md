**Created**: February 2, 2026
**Feature**: `specs/001-uc-13-spec/spec.md`

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all primary user goals and outcomes explicitly stated for review submission? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are all required validation rules for review fields fully specified (types, ranges, allowed formats)? [Gap, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are persistence requirements fully defined, including what data is stored with a review? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §Key Entities]
- [ ] CHK004 Are role-based permissions defined for reviewer vs. editor across submission and visibility? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004, Spec §FR-006, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK005 Are success and failure user notifications defined for all submission outcomes? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK006 Are immutability and resubmission constraints fully specified for review lifecycle? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK007 Are out-of-scope behaviors explicitly stated (e.g., review editing after submission)? [Gap, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK008 Is “immediately after submission” quantified with a measurable time bound? [Clarity, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK009 Are “required fields” and “invalid values” defined with unambiguous criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK010 Is “clear error message” defined with minimum content expectations? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK011 Are “authorization error” conditions precisely defined (who, when, and why)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK012 Do submission constraints (no resubmission, no edits) align across requirements, edge cases, and assumptions? [Consistency, Spec §FR-008, Spec §FR-010, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK013 Do acceptance scenarios match the functional requirements without missing or extra behaviors? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK014 Does the spec’s editor visibility requirement align with success criteria timing? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004, Spec §SC-002]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 Are success criteria measurable without relying on implementation detail? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK016 Are success criteria sufficient to verify the primary user journey completion? [Coverage, Spec §SC-001, Spec §SC-002]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK017 Are alternate flows for invalid input and unauthorized access fully specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK018 Are failure/recovery expectations defined for system or database errors? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK019 Are editor-facing scenarios fully specified (viewing submitted reviews)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are duplicate submission attempts and their outcomes explicitly defined? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK021 Are mid-flow authorization changes (loss of assignment) handled with clear requirements? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK022 Are retry behaviors defined after transient failures without data loss? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK023 Are performance expectations beyond editor visibility defined (e.g., submission response time)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK024 Are security/privacy requirements specified for review data access and storage? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 Are availability/reliability requirements defined for submission service? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK026 Are dependencies on existing CMS services (auth, assignment, storage) explicitly documented? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK027 Are assumptions about invitation acceptance state and review form definition validated? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK028 Is any terminology inconsistent (e.g., “review submission” vs “review form submission”)? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK029 Are there any conflicting requirements between spec and plan (manual testing vs. acceptance criteria)? [Conflict, Spec §Success Criteria, Plan §Technical Context]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK030 Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-13.md` [Traceability]
- [ ] CHK031 Acceptance tests updated in `UC-13-AT.md` [Traceability]
- [ ] CHK032 MVC separation validated (model/view/controller) [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK033 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks) [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
