**Purpose**: Validate requirements completeness, clarity, and coverage for the editor workflow to view completed reviews.
**Created**: 2026-02-02
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-uc-14/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are out-of-scope behaviors explicitly stated to bound the feature? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK002 Are required review fields explicitly defined or referenced to a named review form? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are empty-state requirements defined for papers with zero completed reviews? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK004 Is “completed review” defined unambiguously (e.g., based on submission status)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK005 Is “assigned editor” defined with clear ownership rules for a paper? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK006 Is “user-friendly error message” clarified with minimum content or tone expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK007 Are access-control requirements consistent between FR-005, FR-007, and FR-009? [Consistency, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-007, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK008 Do clarifications and assumptions align with functional requirements for reviewer identity visibility? [Consistency, Spec §FR-008, Spec §Clarifications]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK009 Are success criteria measurable without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001–SC-004]
- [ ] CHK010 Do success criteria cover access control, completeness of reviews, and error handling? [Coverage, Spec §SC-002–SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK011 Are primary, alternate, and exception scenarios each represented by explicit requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1–3]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the “immediate visibility after submission” timing requirement captured in scenarios and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §FR-010]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK013 Are boundary cases such as duplicate displays or partial data addressed in requirements? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK014 Are unauthorized access attempts explicitly handled without content leakage? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-005, Spec §FR-007]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK015 Are performance expectations for loading completed reviews explicitly defined in the requirements or success criteria? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK016 Are privacy/security expectations for reviewer identity exposure defined beyond access control? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK017 Are assumptions about existing CMS review forms validated or referenced to a source of truth? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK018 Are dependencies on CMS availability or retrieval services documented as requirements or constraints? [Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK019 Are any terms like “clear message” or “required review fields” quantified to avoid interpretation drift? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-003, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK020 Are there any conflicts between reviewer identity visibility and confidentiality expectations documented in the spec? [Conflict, Spec §FR-008, Spec §Assumptions]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK021 Is the feature traceable to UC-14 in the spec and plan? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK022 Are acceptance tests identified as the contract for behavior changes? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
