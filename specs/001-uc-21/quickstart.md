# Quickstart: Pay Conference Registration Fee Online

## Purpose
This feature plan aligns implementation to UC-21 and UC-21-AT for online card payments.

## How to Validate
1. Use the acceptance tests in `UC-21-AT.md` as the execution checklist.
2. Verify success, failure, pending confirmation (24-hour timeout), duplicate confirmation handling, and already-paid blocking behavior.

## Notes
- No runnable application is defined in this plan; implementation should follow the MVC structure described in `plan.md`.
