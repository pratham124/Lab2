# Requirements Quality Checklist: Upload Manuscript File

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and coverage of the manuscript upload requirements
**Created**: February 1, 2026
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-upload-manuscript/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all manuscript formats explicitly enumerated, including the LaTeX `.zip` constraint? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK002 Is the maximum upload size stated as a numeric limit with units? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for associating the upload to the correct submission? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK004 Is replacement behavior for re-uploads explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK005 Is indefinite retention defined with a clear authority for deletion? [Completeness, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK006 Are access restrictions for stored manuscripts explicitly specified by role? [Completeness, Spec §FR-015]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the prohibition of public direct URL access explicitly stated? [Completeness, Spec §FR-016]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK008 Is “success confirmation” described with specific required content (e.g., filename or status) rather than a vague statement? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK009 Are “inline error messages” defined with clear placement and content expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK010 Is “most recently uploaded” unambiguous about how rapid successive uploads are handled? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]
- [ ] CHK011 Is “authorized user” for deletion explicitly defined (roles/permissions)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK012 Is “authorized CMS roles” defined with a concrete role list? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-015]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK013 Do user stories and functional requirements agree on accepted formats and size limits? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-002, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK014 Do edge cases align with functional requirements for unauthenticated access and double-submit prevention? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-011, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK015 Do success criteria align with retry behavior and unlimited retries? [Consistency, Spec §FR-010, Spec §SC-005]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK016 Are success criteria measurable without referencing implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §SC-001–SC-005]
- [ ] CHK017 Are success criteria testable for both valid and invalid uploads? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001–SC-004]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are primary, invalid format, oversized, and failure/retry scenarios all specified in requirements or stories? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories 1–3, Spec §FR-007–FR-010]
- [ ] CHK019 Are unauthorized access scenarios explicitly addressed in requirements? [Coverage, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK020 Are replacement scenarios covered in both stories and requirements? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-012]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK021 Are rapid double-submit scenarios specified with expected requirement outcomes? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK022 Are concurrent uploads or overlapping attempts addressed (e.g., two uploads started in parallel)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK023 Are partial upload failures addressed with explicit recovery requirements? [Coverage, Spec §FR-009, Spec §FR-010]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK024 Are performance expectations defined beyond success metrics (e.g., acceptable upload duration or throughput)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK025 Are security and privacy requirements specified for stored manuscripts (role access, no public URLs, storage outside public web root)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-015–FR-017]
- [ ] CHK026 Are availability or reliability targets stated for the upload service? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK027 Are assumptions about the file upload service availability validated or constrained? [Assumption, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK028 Are dependencies on authentication documented with scope (session validity, access checks)? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK029 Is the LaTeX `.zip` acceptance rule consistent across all references (stories, requirements, assumptions)? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, Spec §FR-002, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK030 Are any terms like “accepted formats” or “inline error” defined in a glossary to avoid interpretation drift? [Gap]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK031 Is use-case traceability to UC-05 explicitly preserved in the spec? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK032 Are acceptance tests referenced as the behavioral contract? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK033 Are MVC separation and vanilla stack constraints acknowledged in the plan/spec? [Traceability, Spec §Dependencies]
