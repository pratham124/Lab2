# Security + UX Requirements Checklist: Register User Account

**Purpose**: Validate security- and UX-related requirements for completeness, clarity, and consistency.  
**Created**: February 1, 2026  
**Feature**: ../spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are required registration inputs (email, password) explicitly specified as required fields? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK002 Are email uniqueness rules fully specified, including case-insensitive comparison and whitespace trimming? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 Are duplicate-prevention requirements defined for rapid resubmission scenarios? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK004 Are failure logging requirements defined with minimum fields or content? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK005 Are success redirection requirements explicitly stated with destination? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is "clear, non-technical error messages" defined with specific expectations or examples? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK007 Is "user-friendly reason for failure" quantified or exemplified? [Ambiguity, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK008 Is "complete registration in under 2 minutes" defined with measurement conditions (device/network)? [Ambiguity, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK009 Is "unique, valid email" defined with an email format standard? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK010 Is "retain unrelated form data" defined (which fields, when)? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-009]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do FR-003/FR-003a/FR-003b align with clarifications on case-insensitive uniqueness? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK012 Do password requirements in FR-004 and FR-004a align with Assumptions? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK013 Do edge cases align with user stories and functional requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK014 Do success criteria align with functional requirements for duplicate prevention and error messaging? [Consistency, Spec §SC-003]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK015 Are acceptance scenarios defined for each user story and independently testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK016 Are acceptance scenarios written with clear Given/When/Then outcomes? [Clarity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK017 Are success criteria measurable without implementation details? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK018 Are quantitative thresholds defined for each success criterion (time, rate, percentage)? [Completeness, Spec §Success Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are primary registration flow requirements fully specified from registration option to login redirect? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK020 Are alternate validation failure scenarios covered (duplicate email, invalid format, missing fields, bad password)? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK021 Are system error scenarios covered with user-facing guidance? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK022 Are recovery expectations after system error specified (retry timing, user guidance)? [Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK023 Are double-submit behaviors defined beyond "prevent duplicates" (e.g., user feedback/state)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK024 Are whitespace handling rules specified for both validation and stored email? [Coverage, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK025 Are required-field behaviors specified per field (email vs password)? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK026 Are password failure responses defined to include minimum policy requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]
- [ ] CHK027 Are input normalization rules consistent across validation and logging? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK028 Are accessibility requirements specified for registration form interactions? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK029 Are security/privacy requirements specified for credential protection and storage? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK030 Are requirements defined for protecting against automated/bulk registration attempts? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK031 Are availability/reliability expectations defined for registration service failures? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK032 UC [Gap]
- [ ] CHK033 Are performance requirements for registration feedback (latency) explicitly quantified? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK034 Is the assumption about additional password rules explicitly documented and bounded? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK035 Are out-of-scope items (email verification, CAPTCHA, MFA) clearly enumerated and consistent? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK036 Are external dependencies (e.g., email notification system from UC-01) explicitly referenced in the spec? [Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK037 Are terms like "valid", "compliant", and "unique" defined to avoid multiple interpretations? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Story 1]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK038 Is use-case traceability explicitly mapped to `UC-01.md`? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK039 Is acceptance-test linkage explicitly mapped to `UC-01-AT.md`? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK040 Is MVC separation requirement explicitly documented in requirements or assumptions? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK041 Is the vanilla stack constraint (HTML/CSS/JS only) explicitly documented in requirements or assumptions? [Gap]
