**Purpose**: Validate that the requirements are complete, clear, consistent, and measurable for the schedule viewing feature.
**Created**: February 3, 2026
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-view-conference-schedule/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all primary user goals fully specified for viewing published schedules? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK002 Are requirements defined for unpublished schedule access (message and visibility)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for optional day/session filtering if available? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for handling incomplete schedule entries (missing time/location)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK005 Are dependencies or prerequisites for schedule publication explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §Assumptions]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK006 Is “public access” clearly defined as no-login access for published schedules? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK007 Is “user-friendly error” clarified enough to be objectively assessed (message intent, no sensitive detail)? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the filter behavior precise about when filters exist versus when they are absent? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK009 Are schedule entry fields (title, time slot, location) defined without ambiguity? [Clarity, Spec §Key Entities]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK010 Do user stories and functional requirements describe the same access policy (public, no login)? [Consistency, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK011 Do edge cases align with functional requirements for retrieval failure and missing data? [Consistency, Spec §Edge Cases, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK012 Are success criteria consistent with requirements about completeness and visibility of entries? [Consistency, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK013 Are acceptance scenarios testable without inferring missing steps or conditions? [Measurability, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK014 Are success criteria measurable with explicit targets (time, percentage, or satisfaction metric)? [Measurability, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [ ] CHK015 Do acceptance scenarios cover the clarified retry behavior on retrieval failure? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary, alternate (unpublished), and exception (retrieval failure) scenarios explicitly covered? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK017 Are recovery behaviors defined for retry after failure? [Coverage, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK018 Are optional filter scenarios present without expanding scope beyond “if already available”? [Coverage, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK019 Are zero-result filter outcomes defined (message and reset behavior)? [Completeness, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK020 Are rules explicit for excluding incomplete entries (missing time/location)? [Coverage, Spec §Functional Requirements]
- [ ] CHK021 Are error states and unavailable schedule states distinguished clearly? [Clarity, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK022 Are performance goals specified with measurable thresholds for schedule rendering? [Measurability, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK023 Are accessibility requirements for public schedule viewing explicitly defined? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK024 Are availability or reliability expectations for viewing published schedules documented? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK025 Are assumptions about publication state and data source explicitly stated and scoped? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK026 Are any external dependencies for schedule data retrieval documented? [Gap]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK027 Is any vague language (e.g., “clear and organized format”) quantified or clarified? [Ambiguity, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK028 Are there any conflicts between success criteria and hidden-entry rule for incomplete entries? [Conflict, Spec §Success Criteria, Spec §Functional Requirements]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK029 Is use-case traceability explicitly documented to `UC-19.md`? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK030 Are acceptance tests referenced and updated in `UC-19-AT.md`? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK031 Is MVC separation acknowledged as a constraint for implementation planning? [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK032 Is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS compliance explicitly stated? [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
