**Created**: February 3, 2026
**Feature**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/001-view-registration-prices/spec.md

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all primary user goals explicitly captured in user stories? [Completeness, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]

- [ ] CHK003 Are requirements defined for inactive category handling? [Completeness, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK004 Are requirements defined for categories missing price amounts? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009]
- [ ] CHK005 Are requirements defined for the “pricing is not available” empty-state conditions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003, FR-010]
- [ ] CHK006 Are requirements defined for retrieval failure messaging? [Completeness, Spec §FR-004]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 Is the exact empty-state message text specified and consistent? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003, AC-003, SC-002]
- [ ] CHK008 Is “Not available” explicitly defined as the display for missing price amounts? [Clarity, Spec §FR-009, AC-009]
- [ ] CHK009 Is “inactive category” clearly defined in terms of visibility expectations? [Clarity, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK010 Are terms like “current prices” and “category labels” defined with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK011 Do user stories, functional requirements, and acceptance criteria align on public access without login? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1, FR-007, AC-007]
- [ ] CHK012 Is the empty-state condition consistently described across stories, requirements, and success criteria? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2, FR-003, FR-010, SC-002]
- [ ] CHK013 Are error message expectations consistent between requirements and acceptance scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004, User Story 3]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK014 Are acceptance criteria objectively testable without implementation assumptions? [Measurability, Spec §Acceptance Criteria]
- [ ] CHK015 Do acceptance criteria cover all functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-010)? [Coverage, Spec §Functional Requirements, §Acceptance Criteria]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK016 Are primary, alternate, and error scenarios fully specified in user stories and acceptance scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Scenarios & Testing]
- [ ] CHK017 Are public access and category filtering scenarios captured as independent testable slices? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1, UC-20-AT]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK018 Are edge cases for “all categories inactive” and “all categories missing prices” fully specified (expected message and behavior)? [Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases, FR-010]
- [ ] CHK019 Is the behavior for mixed states (some active, some inactive, some missing amounts) explicitly defined? [Gap]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK020 Is the 2-second visibility target clearly scoped to the pricing view entry point? [Clarity, Spec §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK021 Are accessibility requirements for the pricing view specified or intentionally excluded? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK022 Are localization constraints explicitly stated and consistent with all UI messages? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK023 Are dependencies on pricing data availability and retrieval service explicitly documented? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK024 Are assumptions about currency/formatting explicitly stated and consistent? [Consistency, Spec §Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK025 Is the scope statement consistent with “access-required messaging,” given public access is required? [Conflict, Spec §Scope, FR-007]
- [ ] CHK026 Are any terms like “current prices” or “clear message” defined with measurable criteria? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-002, FR-003]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK027 Use-case traceability: mapped to `UC-20.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK028 Acceptance tests updated in `UC-20-AT.md` [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK029 MVC separation requirement acknowledged for design/implementation plans [Traceability, Plan §Constitution Check]
- [ ] CHK030 Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only (no frameworks) [Traceability, Plan §Constitution Check]
