# Phase 0 Research

## Decision: Vanilla web stack only
- **Rationale**: Constitution requires HTML/CSS/JS without frameworks; feature is display-only.
- **Alternatives considered**: UI frameworks (rejected by constitution).

## Decision: Browser-based delivery
- **Rationale**: Feature is attendee-facing and aligns with existing CMS access patterns.
- **Alternatives considered**: Native mobile app (out of scope).

## Decision: Read-only access to pricing data
- **Rationale**: Feature only displays pricing and does not modify data.
- **Alternatives considered**: Allow edits from pricing view (out of scope).
