# Requirements Quality Checklist: Send Decision Notification

**Purpose**: Validate completeness, clarity, consistency, and measurability of requirements across all domains for UC-15 decision notification.
**Created**: 2026-02-03
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are all editor decision actions (record, send, resend) explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001, §FR-007, §FR-015]
- [ ] CHK002 Are author visibility requirements defined for recorded decisions? [Completeness, Spec §FR-009, §FR-013]
- [ ] CHK003 Are notification delivery outcomes (sent/failed/partial) explicitly required? [Completeness, Spec §FR-006, §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK004 Are constraints on decision immutability specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-011]
- [ ] CHK005 Are duplicate send handling requirements defined? [Completeness, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK006 Are role-based access boundaries defined for non-editors? [Completeness, Spec §FR-003]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK007 Is "immediately after recording" defined with a measurable timing threshold? [Clarity, Spec §FR-013, §SC-002]
- [ ] CHK008 Is the "success/failure confirmation within 10 seconds" timing window unambiguous about start and end points? [Clarity, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK009 Is "partial success" defined with criteria for which authors count as failed? [Clarity, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK010 Is "no auto-retry" scoped to system-initiated retries and not editor-initiated resends? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012, §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK011 Are "duplicate send attempts" defined by scope (same paper, same decision, timing window)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK012 Do resend requirements align with partial delivery reporting requirements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-014, §FR-015]
- [ ] CHK013 Do author visibility requirements align with notification failure behavior? [Consistency, Spec §FR-013, §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK014 Do access control requirements align with the non-editor scenario? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK015 Do decision finality requirements align with resend behavior (no decision changes)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011, §FR-015]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK016 Are editor confirmation timing targets measurable and testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001]
- [ ] CHK017 Is the notification delivery target measurable and scoped to operational conditions? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK018 Is unauthorized access prevention measurable via a defined audit or metric? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-003]
- [ ] CHK019 Is author visibility timing measurable and testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-002]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK020 Are primary flow requirements mapped to acceptance scenarios? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK021 Are alternate flows for incomplete reviews specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 2, §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK022 Are recovery flows for notification failure and resend specified? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 3, §FR-007, §FR-015]
- [ ] CHK023 Are author-view scenarios specified independently of notification outcomes? [Coverage, Spec §User Story 4, §FR-009]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK024 Are duplicate send attempts explicitly bounded and handled? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK025 Is storage failure behavior fully specified (no decision, no notification, editor informed)? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-008]
- [ ] CHK026 Is partial notification delivery behavior specified including editor feedback and failed recipients list? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-014]
- [ ] CHK027 Are resend attempts limited to failed recipients explicitly stated as requirements? [Edge Case, Spec §FR-015]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK028 Are performance targets tied to specific user-visible events? [NFR, Spec §SC-001, §SC-002, §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK029 Are reliability expectations beyond success rate (e.g., retry strategy) explicitly defined or intentionally excluded? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK030 Are security/privacy requirements for decision visibility and notification content specified beyond role restriction? [Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK031 Are assumptions about notification content captured and aligned with scope? [Assumption, Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK032 Are dependencies on authentication/roles and review completion explicitly documented? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK033 Are dependencies on notification delivery services documented with expected behavior when unavailable? [Dependency, Spec §Dependencies, §FR-006]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK034 Is "delivery services are available" defined with observable conditions? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-005, §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK035 Are review-completion criteria aligned between requirements and scenarios? [Consistency, Spec §FR-002, Spec §User Story 2]

## Constitution Compliance

- [ ] CHK036 Is use-case traceability documented to `UC-15.md`? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK037 Are acceptance tests referenced to `UC-15-AT.md`? [Traceability, Spec §Use Case Mapping]
- [ ] CHK038 Are MVC separation constraints stated in requirements or plan? [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
- [ ] CHK039 Is vanilla HTML/CSS/JS compliance stated in constraints? [Traceability, Plan §Technical Context]
