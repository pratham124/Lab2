# Implementation Plan: Send Decision Notification

**Branch**: `002-send-decision-notification` | **Date**: 2026-02-03 | **Spec**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/002-send-decision-notification/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-send-decision-notification/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement editor decision recording and author notification flows for UC-15, including decision finality, immediate in-system visibility, partial delivery reporting, and controlled resend behavior. The plan uses a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript MVC approach with REST-style contracts and no external frameworks.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript (ES2020)  
**Primary Dependencies**: None (vanilla only)  
**Storage**: Existing CMS storage (implementation-specific)  
**Testing**: Manual execution of UC-15-AT acceptance tests  
**Target Platform**: Web application (browser + server)  
**Project Type**: web  
**Performance Goals**: Decision confirmation within 10s; decision visibility within 1 minute; notification delivery within 5 minutes when services are operational  
**Constraints**: MVC separation; vanilla stack only; no auto-retry for notifications; decision final once sent  
**Scale/Scope**: Conference-scale workloads (assume <=10k papers per event)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] Use-case traceability: feature maps to specific `UC-15.md`
- [x] Acceptance tests: relevant `UC-15-AT.md` identified/updated
- [x] MVC separation: model/view/controller boundaries planned
- [x] Vanilla stack: HTML/CSS/JS only; no frameworks or build-tool dependencies

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

- Identify technical choices constrained by the constitution (vanilla stack, MVC).
- Confirm REST-style contracts for decision recording and notification resend.

**Output**: /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/002-send-decision-notification/research.md

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

- Extract entities and rules from spec into `data-model.md`.
- Define REST contracts for decision record, author view, and resend for failed recipients only.
- Produce `quickstart.md` for implementation setup.
- Update agent context via `/root/493-lab/Lab2/.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh codex`.

**Outputs**:
- /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/002-send-decision-notification/data-model.md
- /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/002-send-decision-notification/contracts/decision-notification.openapi.yaml
- /root/493-lab/Lab2/specs/002-send-decision-notification/quickstart.md

## Constitution Check (Post-Design)

- [x] Use-case traceability: UC-15 remains source of truth
- [x] Acceptance tests: UC-15-AT aligns with updated UC-15
- [x] MVC separation: model/service/controller/view roles planned
- [x] Vanilla stack: no framework dependencies introduced

## Phase 2: Planning

Stop after Phase 2 planning. Tasks will be generated by `/speckit.tasks`.
